Do not buy !,"  I've been buying this product for a year, I bought it many times and I would definetely give it 5 start, but...  today when I was enjoying it something very sharp stack deep inside of my tongue.It was piece of very thin still wire of about 0.4 inch of length. It was definitely inside of the seaweed sheet. At first I thought that it is a fish bone in ut it was wire. I'm scared to death now. I was not expecting this to happen.

2,"December 17, 2018",#1 on my list,"  The photo shows the seaweed brands I've tried in order of preference.Jayone: crisp and lightly salted. Delicious at a bargain price. These are great with a meal or just to satisfy those evening cravings. I also cut them up and take them to the theatre in place of popcorn. These are a tiny bit saltier than the gimMe brand.gimMe: very similar if not quite as salty as the Jayone, just a little more expensive and slightly more oil. They seem to flake a little more than the Jayone, but are still very good. I do like having the option to buy 10g trays or 5g trays for taking along as a snack or addition to a meal.Black Label Gourmet: driest and least salty of the bunch, but still a nice crunch. A little different flavor because they're roasted with olive oil instead of sesame or sunflower. They taste a little less sea-like and a little more earthy. These are the ones I like to use to roll salmon or tuna.Wickedly Prime: I can't recommend these at all. Though they supposedly have less salt than a couple of the other brands, they are terribly greasy and taste so salty I couldn't eat them; neither could my family. The only thing I can think to do with them is rinse them and re-roast them to see if they improve.

The pouches arrived the original 24 pack box that was inside an amazon box. I appreciated the Amazon box as I don't want someone to see I have delicious seaweed and decide to take it.

6,"October 18, 2016",A lot of seaweed for the price!,"  I bought this seaweed as a snack food not for sushi, so I can't answer any questions or have any input towards it's position in sushi or rice. I eat it like I'd eat potato chips.I don't think I understood how much seaweed I was getting for the price. I've neever had seaweed and I've never bought it in person so I had no expectations. The massive box showed up filled with a ton of snack pack sized seaweed crisps. My initial taste test of it was not great since I didn't like it too much but it eventually grew on me. If you're new to it or you're feeding it to kids, it takes a couple of tries to know if you like it or not. The packages are easy to open, just tear them like any other snacckfood, and take out the little tray full of sheets.The sheets are a little greasy from whatever processing happens, this isn't an issue at all but I figured I'd mention it. A friend of mine that eats similar products more reguarly figured they needed more salt but they are clearly labeled ""Lightly salted"". Avoid the moisture absorber at the bottom of each pack and you're good to go.

7,"April 6, 2017",Good size snack and very healthy.,"  As someone who has never tried seaweed before these took a minute to get used to. They are thin sheets of dried seaweed in a little plastic tray, in single serving packs. There's a bit of a waste of packaging but I guess there isn't another way to do it without breaking them up. They are kind of fragile. The serving size is generous and very few calories. I got used to the taste by the 2nd or 3rd sheet. It's a little spinachy, that's probably the closest thing I can think of in taste. Not strong though.

This package was okay in terms of overall quality.It is lightly salted as described for those looking to lessen their salt intake. The portions could be bigger because after you're done with a pack you still want more.

Not terrific, but sort of what is expected when you combine seaweed, salt, rice crackers, and sugar. My objection is about 20 minutes after having a handful I was very hot.

I had tried another brand years ago and didn't like it, so I was dubious about any ""fishy"" taste even though I know it's fish that taste like algae (which seaweed is) and not really the reverse... Apparently this brand is mild enough for me.I like to eat them with a little bit of nut or seed butter, with the nori sheets rolled up or folded over or covered with another sheet like a sandwich. I usually eat 2 to 4 small sheets at a time. The remainder in the pack stays fresh if I just put the plastic tray in a sandwich bag and seal with a clothes pin. But I have to keep this bag in a rodent-proof container because apparently a little visitor from the crawlspace thought they were delicious... just a plastic bag was not enough protection!",5.0,JWoolman,tried gimme roasted seaweed flavors sea salt olive oil sesame oil teriyaki tried another brand years ago dubious fishy taste even though know fish taste algae reverse apparently brand mild enough eat little bit nut seed butter nori sheets rolled folded covered another sheet sandwich usually eat small sheets time remainder pack stays fresh put plastic tray sandwich bag seal clothes pin keep bag rodent proof container apparently little visitor crawlspace thought delicious plastic bag enough protection

Additionally, same taste and crunchy as all taste the same to me. Had to Returning the Packages but Amazon was great in accommodating my complaint since I studied the Images and could not reach an Amazon Tech Customer Service due to Virus Limitations before buying GimME. Very disappointed in such overpricing and inaccurate labeling and far less Quantity. The Product is just as good as Kirkland just less for Higher Price. The same goes for Kakoa Friends Brands. They did not provide Flake Number per container unlike COSCTCO providing 50 Flakes per Container on Labels.

523,"March 25, 2020",I love Gimme Teriyaki flavor! A review great for those paying close attention to sodium/nutrition,"  Let me start by saying I LOVE Seaweed snacks. If you're someone who has never tried seaweed snacks before, I would start with Gimme brand Teriyaki flavor to introduce you to it!! This product tastes amazing, and doesn't taste overly greasy/oily like other seaweed snack brands sometimes do. This review is specifically for people watching their sodium intake/are on a sodium restriction/are interesting in hearing my perspective on this brand.I am a Registered Dietitian and often pay close attention to what I chose for myself so that I can better make recommendations for friends/family/clients, and I love that one pack (0.17oz) has 30mg of sodium (salt) and is such a nice healthy delicious snack! For anyone who is put on a low salt diet, depending on what your restriction is (again disclaimer, first check with your doctor and RD) you can comfortably have 3 of these 0.17oz packs, and still be eating less than 100mg of salt.  Something to always look for when checking nutrition facts of snacks is whether or not the information you see in the nutrition label is for the whole container, or if it has multiple servings (in which you would want to multiply whatever you see in the label by the number of servings).I have seen other seaweed snack brands have up to 500mg of sodium or more per seaweed pack which is so insane!! Personally, I am very sensitive to salt so other brands with lots of sodium usually cause me to wake up feeling so swollen, but the Gimme Teriyaki flavor is much lower in salt than other brands so I can relax knowing that if I'm craving it I can relax knowing a few packs won't bother me! I love it! Definitely recommend!Note: The other Gimme Seaweed snack flavors, Sesame Flavor and the Sea Salt, have 65mg per the same 0.17oz bags (still not bad). Still not bad, but I probably would not recommend more than about two 0.17 oz packs for the Sesame and Sea Salt flavors for someone on a strict sodium restriction from their doctor. However, just be careful because the larger 0.35oz size bags for both flavors have 130mg for a whole pack (they mention that they have 65mg per serving with 2 servings).Overall, I think that the Gimme Teriyaki flavor is a great choice given that it is only 30mg sodium per pack compared to 65mg salt per pack of the other flavors, and that even for the larger 0.35 oz of the Teriyaki packs they only have 60 mg salt for the whole pack compared to 130mg per 0.35oz pack of the Sesame and Sea Salt flavors.",5.0,Jaimie L. ,let start saying seaweed snacks someone never tried seaweed snacks start gimme brand teriyaki flavor introduce product tastes taste overly greasy oily seaweed snack brands sometimes review specifically people watching sodium intake sodium restriction interesting hearing perspective brand registered dietitian often pay close attention chose make recommendations friends family clients pack mg sodium healthy delicious snack anyone put low salt diet depending restriction comfortably oz packs still eating less mg salt something always look checking nutrition facts snacks whether information see nutrition label whole container multiple servings seen seaweed snack brands mg sodium per seaweed pack insane personally sensitive salt brands lots sodium usually cause wake feeling swollen gimme teriyaki flavor much lower salt brands relax knowing craving relax knowing packs bother recommend note gimme seaweed snack flavors sesame flavor sea salt mg per oz bags still probably recommend two oz packs sesame sea salt flavors someone strict sodium restriction doctor careful larger oz size bags flavors mg whole pack overall think gimme teriyaki flavor choice given mg sodium per pack compared mg salt per pack flavors even larger oz teriyaki packs mg salt whole pack compared mg per oz pack sesame sea salt flavors

Either way, I still wind up with pieces of seaweed on my shirt and have to check myself in the mirror after eating (also pieces get stuck in my teeth like spinach, so I have learned to check that, too). I like the texture of this seaweed-paper thin, light, and crisp.  I like the flavor-mild.  I prefer this brand to Sea's Gift because of the milder flavor.  They seem fresh.  I did not detect any off-tastes or rancidity.  I appreciate the high vitamin content and the low calories.  I reach for these when I want something crunchy.

796,"July 9, 2011",The Perfect Snack for us,"  I have to admit, before I opened up the Seaweed Snacks, I was expecting a thicker snack because of the picture on the box. When I saw the actual product...I thought...* Wow!...They are sooo thin!.. *Will they have flavor?..*Would they be filling?...  *Will we munch half the boxes up in one sitting trying to feel like we ate something?, and *Did I waste my money?*... Our answer: Definitely NOT wasted money! To our suprise, yesterday, my husband and I shared one .35 oz. pkg, which, with a drink, and found that not only was our serving of the ""wafers"" filling enough to take our hunger away until dinner, but was also very tasty!...(Actually, it was so tasty that today, I ate a whole pkg myself!... They're sooo addicting!!!). The seaweed flavor is strong enough for its taste to come through, but yet, subtle enough to not overwhelm the tastebuds...Yummy!! My husband and I liked the snack so much, I told two of our neighbors about them and let them try some. They also liked them alot, so I gave them each a pkg. to take with them. We even broke the snack into little pieces and let my neighbors' 6 mos. baby suck on them until soft, (when put in the mouth, the hard *wafer* texture  almost immediately  dissolves into the texture of cooked spinach). Once softened she ate about 3 wafers right down!  (If you do let your young child try it..I would strongly recommend an adult breaking, holding, and feeding the small wafer pieces on his/her fingers for the child.) My neighbor said to her husband, *She, (the baby), loves them, too...We have to buy some!*I'm  glad I've found this snack, as being Seaweed, it has soo many more nutritional benefits,(necessary vitamins and minerals, and being low in fat), that I believe it is a great alternative to many of the other snacks that are being sold. It does, however, have a little more salt on it than I would like...(health wise).  It would be nice if they came out with a low,(or at least a lower salt), seaweed snack package...but even if they dont..I will continue to buy these due to their delicious flavor!Anyway, to summarize it all we decided that  [[ASIN:B003NUYBV8 Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, Roasted Sesame, 0.35-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)] will be the Perfect Snack for us and would definitely recommend them!

BUT of all the seaweed snacks I've tried, and I've tried half a dozen at my local health food store, THIS is the one I decided to buy in bulk as a subscription on Amazon (FYI: I spend a fortune at that local health food store, so don't feel too sorry for it, and I have to strike a balance on spending somewhere!).  What makes this snack better than the others?  Three things: 1) the seaweed is in small sheets and is much thinner -- you don't get a big thick layer of it, 2) it has a great distracting hot & salty taste (salt & wasabi) that gives it a refreshing zing, and 3) it has nice crispiness.  I eat sea vegetables for general health (anti-cancer, etc.) and thyroid health.  A few sheets of these a day and I'm good.

1130,"September 28, 2012",Inconsistent Taste,"  I first tasted Annie Chun's seaweed three years ago while in California. It was delicious, especially the Wasabi, so I purchased about ten packs. After returning home, I found it could be ordered from Amazon at a very reasonable price and have purchased them regularly ever since. NO MORE! The last shipment contained a few packages that did not smell right. The pieces of seaweed had a dull, grey coating on them. They tasted terrible. I blew it off the first couple of times and went ahead with another shipment. Last night I opened a container that smelled of burning plastic. The pieces were once again dull and appeared to have a grey coating on them. The coating, unfortunately, was not wasabi. It is strange that not all of the packages have the smell or coating on them, but now I am uncomfortable eating the product. I trusted Annie Chun's product but have decided to stop purchasing it, going with my intuition that there is a problem at the source they are not addressing.",2.0,Mo'ui,first tasted annie chun seaweed three years ago california delicious especially wasabi purchased ten packs returning home ordered amazon reasonable price purchased regularly ever since last shipment contained packages smell pieces seaweed dull grey coating tasted blew first couple times went ahead another shipment last night opened container smelled burning plastic pieces dull appeared grey coating coating wasabi strange packages smell coating uncomfortable eating product trusted annie chun product decided stop purchasing going intuition problem source addressing

I'm not a potato chip person, so maybe if you're a chip-person, these may appeal to you a bit more. I had to use a lot of hand sanitizer to degrease my hands afterwards. (Don't carry napkins in yak) I'll be eating them elsewhere with some chipolte powder.Interestingly, no fiber in these, so it wasn't filling at all. Kinda pointless.

1138,"July 17, 2015",Mmmm.  Fishy paper slime!,"  I found these to be completely disappointing.  I was looking for a healthy, low-carb snack with crunch.  The description/reviews seemed to imply that's what these were.  I was thinking they'd be like kale chips, and I've also had seaweed based snacks that I enjoyed in the past, so I rolled the dice.  I'm a pretty adventurous eater, so why not?  When the box arrived (unfortunately, I'm stuck with 12 packages of these now), I opened the first package and reached in-- what I pulled out was as thin as the thinnest paper (translucent, in fact), and flexible-- when bent in half, they tear a little but do not 'snap.'  There went my hopes of a satisfying crunch.  Still, I ate one.  It tasted like fish, not sesame, and the texture became slimy as I chewed.  In fact, they get nice and wedged into the crevasses of your molars like toffee, so you get to enjoy that fishy taste for a while!  I ate one more ""crisp"" just to be sure I hadn't gotten a bad one... and... yep.  I can't face a third one, even for science.  These were not enjoyable and I suspect I will be hard-pressed to find them a good home.",1.0,Tree,completely disappointing looking healthy low carb snack crunch description reviews seemed imply thinking kale chips also seaweed based snacks enjoyed past rolled dice adventurous eater box arrived opened first package reached pulled thin thinnest paper flexible bent half tear little snap went hopes satisfying crunch still ate tasted fish sesame texture became slimy chewed fact wedged crevasses molars toffee enjoy fishy taste ate crisp sure gotten yep cannot face third even science enjoyable suspect hard pressed find home

1142,"March 15, 2012","Delicious, crispy - an unusual snack","  These seaweed snacks were an impulse item, and I'm so glad we tried them.  There are 12 individually sealed packages in the box, and each package has about 20 super-thin seaweed snacks.  They're almost thin enough to read through, and the whole container only has 2 carbs, making them perfect for low-carb dieters.  They're surprisingly filling, and not overly salty.  They are extremely crispy and the entire package should be eaten soon after opening.  Humidity will make them gummy in just a short time.The nutrition information from Annie Chun's website says that each package of this sesame flavor has: 60 calories, 2 grams protein, 140 mg sodium, 5 grams of fat, 70% of daily vitamin A, 12% of daily vitamin C, and minerals (unnamed on the ingredients list).I like that these are all-natural and don't contain preservatives or food coloring.  I like that it's a novel way to eat vegetables, and that my kids love them. Next we'll try the wasabi flavor.My only complaint about this product is that they use canola oil in them.  Canola oil is in so many foods we eat, and the process used to make it (hexane - a petroleum product, and high heat) causes it to produce free radicals in our body.  Free radicals are linked to obesity, heart disease and degenerative diseases in our bodies.  I would much prefer that all foods be made with cold-pressed oils like olive, peanut or sunflower oil.But canola oil aside, these seaweed snacks are delicious, filling, low carb, and we'll be buying them again.",5.0,Lisa Kearns,seaweed snacks impulse item glad tried individually sealed packages box package super thin seaweed snacks almost thin enough read whole container carbs making low carb dieters surprisingly filling overly salty extremely crispy entire package eaten soon opening humidity make gummy short time nutrition information annie chun website says package sesame flavor calories grams protein mg sodium grams fat daily vitamin daily vitamin minerals natural contain preservatives food coloring novel way eat vegetables kids next try wasabi flavor complaint product use canola oil canola oil many foods eat process used make causes produce free radicals body free radicals linked obesity heart disease degenerative diseases bodies much prefer foods made cold pressed oils olive peanut sunflower oil canola oil aside seaweed snacks delicious filling low carb

Not overly seaweed tasting with a nasty filmy aftertaste.","  I've eaten a lot of seaweed snacks over the decades and Annie Chun's are by far my favorite in taste and texture. Sea Salt and Sesame flavor are fantastic, Wasabi ... not so much, way too strong on the wasabi. Oddly enough, many seaweed snacks can be overly seaweed tasting, maybe too heavy, pressed or cut too thick and often too oily. Trader Joe's has their version in large packs for a dollar, but I rarely finish a single pack as they are just too heavy and don't leave me wanting anymore, I've tried on several occasions. Nasty seaweed snacks often leave a filmy aftertaste in your mouth and the seasonings just don't taste balanced or right, especially as more longterm snack. And that's what I like about Annie Chun's, these snack are pressed thin, have a light crispy chew that breaks down easily, and don't leave your mouth with a gross lingering overwhelming aftertaste from bad seasoning or too much oil. The larger 0.35 oz packs are certainly the way to go compared to those tiny 0.16 oz which I can devour in under a few minutes. Found the larger cases on sale at my local Asian grocer and bought them out, I can easily eat three or more packages of the Sesame or Sea Salt a day without getting burnt out on the flavor and texture.

1386,"May 18, 2014",low-calorie and should appeal to people who like the taste of sesame,"  I recently had a chance to try these.  They're not my favorite thing ever, but they do have some good qualities.  First of all, a serving is only 30 calories.  Granted, they're quite thin and not very substantial.  But enough effort is involved in eating them that you at least feel like you've gone through the motions of eating a snack, and often, for me, that's enough to get rid of my mid-afternoon hunger/boredom.Taste-wise, these remind me of many other kinds of seaweed (nori that I've had with vegetarian California rolls, kombu pieces that end up in my beans, etc.).  I can really taste the sesame oil, as well.  And these are fairly salty, although one serving only has 70 mg of sodium (3% of what you should get daily).  I do not understand why so many of the negative reviewers thought these tasted like fish.  There's no fish in them -- they're vegan!  They're also quite high in vitamin A.These are not going to appeal to everyone.  If you are fond of Asian food, especially Japanese or Korean food, you will probably be a fan of these.  These do leave a bit of oil on your fingertips, by the way.They seem to be pretty shelf-stable.  I left a completely open package on my desk overnight and they tasted the same the first day (and have the same texture) as they did the second day.",4.0,Sneaky Burrito,recently chance try favorite thing ever qualities first serving calories granted quite thin substantial enough effort involved eating least feel gone motions eating snack often enough rid mid afternoon hunger boredom taste wise remind many kinds seaweed taste sesame oil well fairly salty although serving mg sodium understand many negative reviewers thought tasted fish fish vegan also quite high vitamin going appeal everyone fond asian food especially japanese korean food probably fan leave bit oil fingertips way seem shelf stable left completely open package desk overnight tasted first day second day
1387,"December 30, 2011",Very good if you love wasabi flavor/bite and seaweed snacks in general,"  Only get these if you like the taste of wasabi. Although it's a bit more subtle then the wasabi that's dabbed on your sushi, you still definitely get the wasabi bite (they seem to be along the same line of the extra spicy wasabi covered peas, maybe a little bit saltier).  With subscribe and save, these packs come out to $1/pack which is quite a bit cheaper than what you spend outside Amazon (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's or supermarket) for this type of snack.  You do get quite a few sheets in each pack (20) and each one is seasoned with the perfect amount of spicy/hot wasabi and salt.

They are a great snack when you crave something to eat, but are not that hungry. They are low in calories and rather healthy for a snack and if you are dieting eating a few of these is better than going for a full meal. I tried some Costco brand salt seaweed snacks although the Costco seaweed snacks have more in one package they do seem cheaper if that is possible for seaweed snacks and Annie Chun's were more flavorful. The wasabi flavoring is not too strong, but there is a noticeable kick to them.

1391,"September 7, 2012",I really like these; they've inspired me to make my own,"  I'd been curious about seaweed snacks for quite some time.  After trying a pack of Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, I have to say I am a fan.  The snacks are perfect as just that -- a snack.  They have 60 calories per container so you don't have to feel bad about eating one or two containers.The seaweed is thin but has a crispy component.  There is a bit of salt but I wouldn't say that these are anywhere near as salty as a Lay's potato chip.  Initially, the smell of the seaweed seemed very strong.  I don't eat fish but that was all I could think of when eating the first few pieces.  After a while, I didn't notice the scent so much.There are two things that I don't like about this product.  The first is the amount of packaging.  The second is the use of canola oil.  To deal with both, I've started to make my own snacks.  I use nori and apply coconut oil or sesame oil and salt and place it in the oven for a bit.  For those that think these are too salty, the make your own method allows you to control the amount of oil and salt.Made in Korea.If interested in trying a single package of Annie Chun's and your grocery store does not carry the product, try iherb.com.

And if you don't like wonderfully tasty, crispy (and healthy!) snacks, they might not be your thing either!But I'm guessing you already passed these by if you fall into the former category, and I'm guessing not many people fit into the latter.My only complaint with these is that the wasabi coating seems to be slightly variable on them, as in I'll have one piece that's moderately hot, and then another that's really not at all. These are horribly addictive too, so it's not like I can just eat a couple of them anyways! They're fairly healthy, which makes me not feel as bad about sucking down a whole pack, but my wallet is more of a limiting factor than my appetite on buying these damn things!In short, these are tasty but moderately spicy.

1598,"October 1, 2016","I do NOT like healthy, but these are good!","  I am not a nutritionist, so not going to give you my view on the nutrition of the bars. See the ingredients photo attached for details!What I am sharing my opinion on are they real key factors. How it feels, how it chews, how it taste, how it sits in the stomach and how it poops out. For the record, on a scale of 1-10, 10 being best score, I rate me a 1 when it comes to desire to eat healthy and an 8 at actually eating healthy. In fact, right now I am thinking cheesecake and not a healthy snack bar.PACKAGING – Score 9When it comes to the packaging, I find the package is easy to open, even after sitting in my back pocket before a 10 mile run. The bar is always cleanly in the packaging, not sticking too much too it. I have never had a struggle or frustration taking the food out of the package, an experience you always have with sugar daddy’s (of course, my pre-healthy days only).The package is sealed well and keeps the food tasting fresh.CHEW EFFECT – Score 9I like the texture. Once placed in the mouth, the heavens open up, doves flew out and WAM. Okay, maybe that does not happen, but the texture of the food is solid. It is not too hard or too chewy. When you’re done eating, the food is not crammed between teeth cracks or sticking to the top of the mouth.TASTE – Score 10Awesome. Perfect flavor. Not too sweet.SWALLOW EFFECT – Score 10Good. Repeat and it works great.STOMACH ACCEPTANCE – Score 10Simply awesome. My stomach when it comes to sensitivity is extremely high. If I eat items with too much sugar, my stomach turns. The bars sat well.  They do not sit heavy and they digest well. I never have an issue where gas is leaking out of me (or at least where I can blame it on the bars), so my digestive system pushes it a long well. I am sensitive to gluten, but still no issues.TOILET APPROVED – Score 10This part ended quick, fast and smooth. One big splash finished nature’s course and it was a blessing since lactose issues are normal for me.FAMILY APPROVED – Score 10Wife and Kids love them. Wife loves them because they are easy to store and pull when needed!FINAL COMMENTSGreat product, great flavor.

2295,"November 1, 2013","Delicious, but poor shipping methods","  Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snacks are delicious.  I crave them the way most people crave potato chips.  They're low in calories (60 calories for the entire package) and contain beneficial minerals that you might not get elsewhere, so you can eat a ton of them without feeling guilty.  It's an excellent product.The problem was that these were shipped in a bag, not a box.  This would be fine if the plastic box inside the wrapping were rigid, but it's not.  Every box was flattened at some point during shipping.  Seaweed snacks don't really bend without breaking.  Everything was broken into little shards that drifted around the inside of the package during shipping, so when I went to open one of the packages, the seaweed on the outside of its container got all over the place.  Since these are made with oil, it's very hard to get little bits off of a surface.  Eating them without making a mess was equally difficult.  You'd think for $5 shipping the sellers would at least make sure the product made it to the buyer in one piece.  I wish they had taken the care to use a box rather than a bag.  What I really wish was that I'd just made the trip to Trader Joe's and bought them there.

Each package has only 60 calories--and that's for two servings!  The seaweed comes in thin, rectangular sheets of a beautiful shade of green.  As you take a bite, the crisp sheet reminds you of biting into a potato chip or popcorn--crunch and a bit of salt.  Once on your tongue, it begins to dissolve, giving you a more gelatinous texture.  If you enjoy Japanese foods such as sushi, this is for you.What a great, low calorie alternative to take to the movies.

This brand is on the bland and flimsy side of the seaweed snack spectrum, but they are tasty enough. The upside of seaweed snacks for me is the iodine content. If you've never tried seaweed snacks before, they may be an acquired taste. The downside is that they are made with canola oil which is unhealthy because it inhibits enzyme function among other effects. There are other brands which are canola-free. Had these been canola-free, I could only wish that the people who dumped theirs in the trash would have sent them my way. Based on that fact that there are seaweed snacks with healthier ingredients, I won't be buying these again. In fact, I will try making them at home with a recipe found in my search for canola-free snacks. If you do eat these, you may experience digestive upsets if you consume more than a few at a time. I don't know if it's because of the canola oil or if it's seaweed-related, but this seems to be a common side effect.",1.0,Skayea,roasted seaweed snacks purchased directly trader joe store brand bland flimsy side seaweed snack spectrum tasty enough upside seaweed snacks iodine content never tried seaweed snacks acquired taste downside made canola oil unhealthy inhibits enzyme function among effects brands canola free canola free wish people dumped trash sent way based fact seaweed snacks healthier ingredients fact try making home recipe search canola free snacks eat experience digestive upsets consume time know canola oil seaweed related seems common side effect

2366,"April 19, 2012",Addictive and delicious!,"  This review is going to sound very different from a normal one.First off, I would like to point out that yes, I gave it four stars on purpose.  Please keep that in mind and read this very thoroughly.I hate these snacks.  I hate them because they are so insanely addictive, I find it nearly impossible to ""just have one.""  Invariably, I end up consuming the entire package grinning like a giddy schoolchild.  Even if I put them away, I will inevitably find myself searching the package out, just so I can have one more.. and then again, and again, until the package is finally empty, and then I am sad.I hate them because of their fun, paper-thin texture, which makes it seem like you've some piece of unique candy, then it turns out to be a delicious, slightly salty, somewhat chewy snack which makes your brain scream 'Oooh, yay, SUSHI!' only for it to suddenly turn nutty in a twist which makes me want to have just one more to experience that fun crinkle of the sheets (for they are super-thin sheets of dried, roasted seaweed), the YAY of incoming sushi, that slightly chewy transformation, and then they dissolve into almost nothingness, leaving you reaching for another one.I hate them because the pack lasts about 45 minutes.  An hour and a half, if I'm demonstrating exceptionally strong willpower for the day.  Possibly longer if I can manage to convince someone *else* to hide them from me.I hate them because said pack gives me 40% of my Vitamin C for the day in less than half an ounce of actual dried seaweed.  And something that tastes so very delicious isn't supposed to be that healthy.  Bacon doesn't give vitamin C.  These snacks do.  That's confusing.  Snacks are supposed to be guilty pleasures, not delightful dietary supplements.I hate them because the only physical store that carries them in my area is Trader Joe's, and I always end up opening the pack after they are closed.  So when the package is empty and I am sad, I must wait until morning to ""get my fix"" again.I hate them because I ate an entire package while writing this review.  And now it is gone.  And now I am sad.  Thankfully, though, I can get them here and have them delivered to my door.  I might have to order a few of the six packs, though, to last me until the next order I place can arrive.

2614,"January 9, 2019",FINALLY! SOME GOOD ARARE,"  I didn't start out looking for these, but was real glad I did!  I've enjoyed these crackers since I was a kid.  I had a neighbor who was Japanese and introduced me to a lot of fun snacks.  These can be hard to find, depending on where you live, at least good ones.  So after looking at some of the offerings and the prices on Amazon I settled on giving these and the Asia Trans Co. a try.These have wonderful deep soy sauce flavor and color.  And many others I've tried just pale in comparison, seriously, they're a very light color or actually white and there's very little taste.Beware - This particular brand of arare  contain MSG.  So those of you who freak out about this ingredient or are sensitive to it - stay away.The bag came full to the brim in its own resealable bag. The bag itself is pretty thick and I hope the seal is tight enough to keep them fresh.  Nothing worse than getting some of these and the next day or two and they're stale.  In comparing these to the Asia Trans brand, I find these to have a better flavor; that's probably the addition on the msg, but I'll take it.The two bags came in a single box, without  paper or plastic bubble packs so they wouldn't bang around and break into cracker dust.  So I was surprised to find that they're mostly intact.  I poured some in a bowl, tried to get pieces from the bottom as well.  You can see that there are not a lot of broken pieces despite there not being any padding. I also put some on the paper with a bottle cap to show scale, since these are not very large.  I also included a picture of the expiration date, a little over eight months from now.Overall, I'm very satisfied with these and would buy them again.  I'm not sure I'd share them just yet, maybe just direct them to Amazon so they can get their own pack.",5.0,Raevyn77,start looking real glad enjoyed crackers since kid neighbor japanese introduced lot fun snacks hard find depending live least ones looking offerings prices amazon settled giving asia trans co try deep soy sauce flavor color many others tried pale comparison seriously light color white little taste beware particular brand arare contain msg freak ingredient sensitive stay away bag came full brim resealable bag bag thick hope seal tight enough keep fresh nothing worse getting next day two stale comparing asia trans brand find flavor probably addition msg take two bags came single box without paper plastic bubble packs bang around break cracker dust find mostly intact poured bowl tried pieces bottom well see lot broken pieces despite padding also put paper bottle cap show scale since large also included picture expiration date little eight months overall satisfied buy sure share yet direct amazon pack
2615,"October 10, 2016","Delicious, delicious, delicious","  These taste great!  I grew up eating arare (rice crackers) so I consider myself somewhat of a rice cracker snob.  I would always want the pieces that were the darkest, they were either toasted the most or had the most soy sauce on them, either way they had the best flavor.  If you are the kind of person that likes the browned bits of rice that sits in the bottom of your rice cooker then you know what I mean.  These crackers are nice and dark, full of flavor and very crispy.  So many of the rice crackers you see in stores today are pale and don't look too appetizing.  I was somewhat cautious about ordering these rice crackers since they were made in Taiwan and in my opinion the best ones come from Japan.  However these are absolutely delicious. I read that some people have had issues with broken pieces (NOT ME) or the price (about $12.00 per pound).  An 8 ounce package of rice crackers locally sells for $5.00-5.50, That's $10-11 per pound for much inferior rice crackers.  These are not cheap but well worth the price.

The fact that I don't have to bother my friends or relatives there.  Just get this myself.  It's an expensive product, but, 2 lbs, 6 oz, that's alot of mochi crunch in one bottle.  I don't know of any other company that does that.  I think is because they have such a great product that people are willing to pay for a full bottle of arare.

2618,"May 31, 2020",TOTALLY Unacceptable,"  First off, let me say I have in the past always ordered the Aloha brand mix and been extremely satisfied. However when I saw this product with a greater quantity for approximately the same price, I decided to chance it. Bad mistake.When I first opened the package and tasted the mix it was similar to the Aloha brand, but not quite as intense. Still it had an acceptable and pleasing flavor. However when I poured out some mix in a bowl, I was shocked to see that at least the third if not more of all of the small pieces we're broken. See my photo. In fact when I looked closely I saw that there were pieces that were plain and others that had seaweed in them.

Since Umeya is no more, I started looking for a good alternative. The best tasting and best deal I've found is the Tomoe Brand Hawaiian Mix Arare in the jumbo bag. These have really good flavor and the 38 oz bag lasts for a while. One big plus is they don't use those chemical food coloring dyes to make their Arare like a lot of the other companies do.

2931,"November 1, 2013","Delicious, but poor shipping methods","  Trader Joe's Roasted Seaweed Snacks are delicious.  I crave them the way most people crave potato chips.  They're low in calories (60 calories for the entire package) and contain beneficial minerals that you might not get elsewhere, so you can eat a ton of them without feeling guilty.  It's an excellent product.The problem was that these were shipped in a bag, not a box.  This would be fine if the plastic box inside the wrapping were rigid, but it's not.  Every box was flattened at some point during shipping.  Seaweed snacks don't really bend without breaking.  Everything was broken into little shards that drifted around the inside of the package during shipping, so when I went to open one of the packages, the seaweed on the outside of its container got all over the place.  Since these are made with oil, it's very hard to get little bits off of a surface.  Eating them without making a mess was equally difficult.  You'd think for $5 shipping the sellers would at least make sure the product made it to the buyer in one piece.  I wish they had taken the care to use a box rather than a bag.  What I really wish was that I'd just made the trip to Trader Joe's and bought them there.  I'm very disappointed.",2.0,Caroline,trader joe roasted seaweed snacks delicious crave way people crave potato chips low calories contain beneficial minerals might elsewhere eat ton without feeling guilty product problem shipped bag box fine plastic box inside wrapping rigid every box flattened point shipping seaweed snacks bend without breaking everything broken little shards drifted around inside package shipping went open packages seaweed outside container got place since made oil hard little bits surface eating without making mess equally difficult think shipping sellers least make sure product made buyer piece wish taken care use box rather bag wish made trip trader joe bought

2939,"July 4, 2011",Satisfying Salty Sea Snack,"  This salty, savory gem is so satisfying.  Packaged in an airtight container, it is as fresh and crisp as the moment it was packed at the factory.  Each package has only 60 calories--and that's for two servings!  The seaweed comes in thin, rectangular sheets of a beautiful shade of green.  As you take a bite, the crisp sheet reminds you of biting into a potato chip or popcorn--crunch and a bit of salt.  Once on your tongue, it begins to dissolve, giving you a more gelatinous texture.  If you enjoy Japanese foods such as sushi, this is for you.What a great, low calorie alternative to take to the movies.  Or, to lunch, to eat at your desk, in the car, at sports events, on the plane.  Easy to handle, small, crunchy, salty, chewy.

2984,"February 12, 2018",Not A Healthy Snack,"  I love roasted seaweed snacks. I have purchased these directly from a Trader Joe's store. This brand is on the bland and flimsy side of the seaweed snack spectrum, but they are tasty enough. The upside of seaweed snacks for me is the iodine content. If you've never tried seaweed snacks before, they may be an acquired taste. The downside is that they are made with canola oil which is unhealthy because it inhibits enzyme function among other effects. There are other brands which are canola-free. Had these been canola-free, I could only wish that the people who dumped theirs in the trash would have sent them my way. Based on that fact that there are seaweed snacks with healthier ingredients, I won't be buying these again. In fact, I will try making them at home with a recipe found in my search for canola-free snacks. If you do eat these, you may experience digestive upsets if you consume more than a few at a time. I don't know if it's because of the canola oil or if it's seaweed-related, but this seems to be a common side effect.",1.0,Skayea,roasted seaweed snacks purchased directly trader joe store brand bland flimsy side seaweed snack spectrum tasty enough upside seaweed snacks iodine content never tried seaweed snacks acquired taste downside made canola oil unhealthy inhibits enzyme function among effects brands canola free canola free wish people dumped trash sent way based fact seaweed snacks healthier ingredients fact try making home recipe search canola free snacks eat experience digestive upsets consume time know canola oil seaweed related seems common side effect

3002,"April 19, 2012",Addictive and delicious!,"  This review is going to sound very different from a normal one.First off, I would like to point out that yes, I gave it four stars on purpose.  Please keep that in mind and read this very thoroughly.I hate these snacks.  I hate them because they are so insanely addictive, I find it nearly impossible to ""just have one.""  Invariably, I end up consuming the entire package grinning like a giddy schoolchild.  Even if I put them away, I will inevitably find myself searching the package out, just so I can have one more.. and then again, and again, until the package is finally empty, and then I am sad.I hate them because of their fun, paper-thin texture, which makes it seem like you've some piece of unique candy, then it turns out to be a delicious, slightly salty, somewhat chewy snack which makes your brain scream 'Oooh, yay, SUSHI!' only for it to suddenly turn nutty in a twist which makes me want to have just one more to experience that fun crinkle of the sheets (for they are super-thin sheets of dried, roasted seaweed), the YAY of incoming sushi, that slightly chewy transformation, and then they dissolve into almost nothingness, leaving you reaching for another one.I hate them because the pack lasts about 45 minutes.  An hour and a half, if I'm demonstrating exceptionally strong willpower for the day.  Possibly longer if I can manage to convince someone *else* to hide them from me.I hate them because said pack gives me 40% of my Vitamin C for the day in less than half an ounce of actual dried seaweed.  And something that tastes so very delicious isn't supposed to be that healthy.  Bacon doesn't give vitamin C.  These snacks do.  That's confusing.  Snacks are supposed to be guilty pleasures, not delightful dietary supplements.I hate them because the only physical store that carries them in my area is Trader Joe's, and I always end up opening the pack after they are closed.  So when the package is empty and I am sad, I must wait until morning to ""get my fix"" again.I hate them because I ate an entire package while writing this review.  And now it is gone.  And now I am sad.  Thankfully, though, I can get them here and have them delivered to my door.  I might have to order a few of the six packs, though, to last me until the next order I place can arrive.  I'm working out a rationing calendar that I probably won't stick to for more than an hour.And finally, I hate that I don't hate these at all, but am hopelessly and utterly addicted to them.

I'm looking for a sinus flush reaction!  When I found clusters of crackers I got the one-two punch effect, but it dissipated quickly.  My husband could tell when I was eating these because they had an odor.  Our office is 37 feet long and I am behind a hutch.  He could smell them as he was coming up the stairs, which are across the room from my desk.  He would say, ""damnit, baby, are you eating Those Things again?!""  I would proudly smile and stuff another handful in my mouth as I nodded emphatically.  :DThe best thing about these - no Peas!  I never had to worry about cracking a tooth on a cracker that was denser than it was supposed to be and that's a big bonus.

3243,"February 23, 2019","All kinds of wrong, and absolutely addictive","  Man, there is so much that is wrong with pork scratchings, and I love them for every single thing.First, this product is not at all the same as pork rinds as you know them in the States. If you buy pork scratchings thinking they are the same, you will be revolted. If - like me, when I first came here - you buy pork rinds thinking they are the same as pork scratchings, you will be depressed at the state of modern humanity.Both products are made from pigs, and both taste of pork. There the resemblance ends.Now, my memory is that these used to be called pork crackling back in the day, a traditional British snack that you bought in the pub with a beer, or loosely packed in plastic bags from old-school butchers. But everyone called them pork scratchings, and the manufacturers fell into line some time ago.You do not want to think about why we called them pork scratchings, or about what they are, or what they look like. All you need to know is that they are delicious.What you get is a whole bunch of teeny, tiny packets of triple-fried pork skins. Little lumps of massive salted pork flavor from the skin and occasional flecks of meat, and supercharged umami from the generous coating of fat on each piece. In the butchers' version you could also sometimes find bonus treats like triple-fried hair or pig's nipple, but I've not found those here (shame!). It's the flavor, the umami, and the salt that you're buying here, and as I see it, in each teeny tiny packet you get twice as much flavor as in a big bag of US-style pork rinds. It's a bargain.To put it another way; you know those roasted seaweed snacks you can get from Korea? Healthy, delicate and nicely balanced whispers that melt in your mouth? British pork scratchings are the precise opposite of that.Have I mentioned the crunch? It's a great crunch. So good in fact, and so strong, that you won't even notice if you break a tooth when biting down. (Which was a distinct risk when eating pork scratchings back in the day. They seem to have pulled back a bit on the modern crunch. I blame dentists for that.)I love them and you will too (I'm assuming you're not a vegetarian if you're reading this review).You have been warned.",5.0,m b,man much wrong pork scratchings every single thing first product pork rinds know states buy pork scratchings thinking revolted first came buy pork rinds thinking pork scratchings depressed modern humanity products made pigs taste pork resemblance ends memory used called pork crackling back day traditional british snack bought pub beer loosely packed plastic bags old school butchers everyone called pork scratchings manufacturers fell line time ago want think called pork scratchings look need know delicious whole bunch teeny tiny packets triple fried pork skins little lumps massive salted pork flavor skin occasional flecks meat supercharged umami generous coating fat piece butchers version also sometimes find bonus treats triple fried hair pig nipple flavor umami salt see teeny tiny packet twice much flavor big bag us style pork rinds bargain put another way know roasted seaweed snacks korea healthy delicate nicely balanced whispers melt mouth british pork scratchings precise opposite mentioned crunch crunch fact strong even notice break tooth biting warned

It arrived almost exactly (2 days less) than a month after purchase. The contents were varied and closely resembled what I had expected (from product pictures). There was an expiration date guide included. One item (one of the sticks in the top right of my photo) expired 2 days after arrival, so we ate that first (it was tasty).

3569,"January 3, 2015",great seller! So I like most of the colors,"  I ordered my pack from Kolorize Me whom I also reviewed, great seller! So I like most of the colors. The metallics are gorgeous but not what I was expecting. They're not quite what I personally would call metallic. More like a very heavy pearl. Still gorgeous! But I'll have to look elsewhere for the perfect metallic polish. The neons are gorgeous and CRAZY BRIGHT! Not quite neon but the next tier of obnoxiously bright. The pastels are perfect! They remind me of Easter lol. The only one I didn't like that much was the purple. Well, I like it but I think it's too dark for pastel (very pale skin here). I also got the holo polishes that KC makes. I really love Chunky Holo Black the best (I think everyone does). The formula for these polishes doesn't really seem to be incredibly consistent. I played around with about 30 different colors already and can see that some of the polishes apply REALLY well and others don't. Meaning, some I could apply one coat and get away with. Others, I gave up at 3. The obvious ones are the holos, I know that already. But others like Neon Lime, Funky Yellow and Sheer Lilac were still pretty see through. For the purposes I need them for (Stamping and nail art), I'll have to mess around with each color individually to get a feel for it or else I wind up with splotchy nails that look like a mess. For the price you pay on this particular pack, it's a killer deal. I'd definitely recommend it for someone who is looking into playing around with a lot of color or is maybe a novice. The price = many chances to mess up and not worry. But if you're used to QUALITY nail polish, I'd steer clear of this. I attached a photo , please ignore the 6 in the middle and the lip gloss.

356,03-Dec-18,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"I recieved a coupon/voucher for a full size product of Ocean Halo's Seaweed Snacks & I tried out their chili lime flavor. It was pretty good in flavor. I don't regularly eat seaweed but when I do it's usually in sushi, like a veggie sushi. Seaweed on its own or unflavored seaweed is usually kind of bitter & has its own unique or ""special"" taste & could be described as an acquired taste. It usually is a bit more palatable when accompanied by other ingredients. I liked the chili lime seaweed because it has a mild & not too over seasoned flavor of both the chili & lime. I used my package to garnish some fish tacos that I made & it paired pleasantly well. I also crushed up a few & added them to a salad. Speaking for myself I liked the pairing of those two items I used the seaweed with. I didn't snack on the seaweed by itself as I don't eat it that regularly & by itself, flavored or unflavored, I'm not that fond of. It is a great tasting product for being seaweed & is packaged well. I don't think I will be buying it again as I don't regularly consume all that much seaweed as part of my diet. I would recommend it to someone who happens to enjoy it on a more consistent basis or I would pick it up sometime maybe down the line if I happen to be in the mood for something different than the usual snacks or food items I pick up.

505,28-Oct-18,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,I am giving Ocean's Halo seaweed snack 3 stars. The snack is paper thin and pretty much melts on your tongue. It is slightly fishy tasting which was a turn off for me altogether. I will say that I purchased 2 different flavors. The sea salt which was most fishy.

I felt as though the sheets could use a lot more flavor. I offered a sheet to one of my coworkers, who also enjoys seaweed, and he felt similarly. It tasted fairly bland either by itself or with rice and filling, to the point where I had to add my own seasoning. Suggestions: I would have liked to see a vegan label on the Bacon variety, as the reason I passed it up was because I believed that animal products were used when that is not the case.
