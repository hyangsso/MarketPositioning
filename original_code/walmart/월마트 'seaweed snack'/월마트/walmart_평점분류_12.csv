1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashley F.,",24-Jan-20,I wasn't a big fan I really didnt like the flavor at all. I also don't like sea weed so that could also be the problem if you like seaweed you might actually like this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brenda B.,",19-Jan-20,I did not like the taste and the texture of the Seaweed snacks. It tasted fishy. I have liked the other Oceans Halo products that I have tried [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Patricia D.,",21-Feb-20,"I did not enjoy the taste or texture of this product so I do not recommend this product. It is on the pricy side also, and kind of hard to find in the store [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"michael L.,",22-Jan-20,"It has a good crunch, not too salty with enough wasabi flavor. It was good as a snack it self or on top of rice. Good flavor. Going to try different one [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Katharine W.,",03-Mar-20,I tried the pho soup kit. It was incredibly salty and kind of bland. I make better pho broth than this and would not buy it as a quick meal. I would rather make my own from scratch or go out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Patricia C.,",30-Jan-20,"They were nasty. After the first crunch they turned slimy and tasted like fish. I was not a fan of those and neither was my son, and he likes sushi. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vanessa M.,",14-Nov-19,So ill personally never buy this product again the after taste was horrible it went down easy. But not something I'd recommend to anyone the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because it looks nice. Just doesn't taste good at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Megan M.,",16-Dec-19,"Well....I was very excited to try some of these products because I LOVE Asian food. Today I purchased the seaweed snacks and the ramen bowl. I was very eager to try it so I ripped it open as soon as I got into the car and put a piece into my mouth......And then I almost threw up immediately. I hate to sound dramatic but it's true. I'm not 100% sure if it was a texture thing or an actual taste thing but it was awful!! It took EVERYTHING in my power to not throw up in my car. I had to dig in my center console for a piece of gum to help get the taste out of my mouth. I am still looking forward to trying other products in this line, but the seaweed snacks are definitely not for me. I also purchased the wasabi flavor but I am TERRIFIED to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hannah W.,",16-Dec-19,"I've never tried seaweed before, so i wasn't really sure what to expect with these snacks. I wasn't a fan, especially of the overwhelming salty fish taste. Someone who likes seaweed tried it though and he liked it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
1,Gross,"Mace,",01-Jul-20,"this tastes like lakewater, like you just swallowed a lakewater."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tara F.,",18-Nov-19,"I bought these because I got the coupons. My family had never tried them. Turned out they didnt like them. But,it was worth it to try them. Y ok u never know. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Meagan B.,",24-Nov-18,I am already not a fan if seaweed but Love sushi so I was excited to give this a try. I got the bacon flavor. The flavor was ok but the sheets could have been in smaller size where you just pick and eat. After 2 pieces I threw this product away because the fishy taste was so bad I could not take it anymore and this is coming from someone who is not a picky eater all and loves fish as well.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heather F.,",25-Nov-18,"I didn't really enjoy these. I got the sea salt variety but the overall flavor just wasn't for me. It left a weird after taste. I didn't enjoy the texture either. I'm looking forward to trying other products from this brand, however. This one just wasn't for me. #GotItFree"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kat G.,",25-Nov-18,I was intrigued when i opened the package. Ive has sushi before so i knew I liked seaweed. I thought i would like the crunchy texture and i did. But I didnt like the flavor at all. I had the seaweed one and it just tasted like sour salty green stuff. I wouldn't buy it again. I just didn't care for the flavor.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"nic S.,",15-Nov-18,I received this product via Free coupon in exchange for my honest review from social nature. While I was very excited to try this product I wasn't very pleased with its taste. I choose the sea salt flavor because I thought it was safe. I am not a huge sea food fan; in fact most sea food makes me sick to my stomach. This smelled salty and tasted like salted algae(sp). I actually had to run to the trash can after kinda chewing it because I almost threw up in my mouth. If you like fish or shrimp you'll probably like this but its not for me. I'd still like to give some of their other products a try but I will never touch seaweed again. LOL
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ruthelle L.,",13-Jan-19,"I got the sea salt organic seaweed snacks. The seaweed sheets are very thin. I tried one by just eating it by itself. I was not very fond of the taste or aftertaste. So I decided to give it another try and had some with white rice. This taste was much better when I had it wrapped around the rice. However, the aftertaste still wasn't pleasant for me. So sadly I wouldn't purchase this specific product again because I didn't like the lingering aftertaste."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen M.,",11-Nov-18,"I tried the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks Sea Salt flavor and was not impressed. First, they are see- through thin and they're a size that is too big to fit the whole sheet in your mouth, but when you try to just bite a piece off or fold it in half they break and crumble. And I'm not a fan of seafood at all so maybe that's why I didn't like the taste or smell. Maybe a stronger flavor like wasabi or sriracha would mask the sea smell better and make them more edible to me."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Samantha G.,",28-Jan-19,"I was absolutely not the audience for these seaweed things. I put one in my mouth and it got stuck to my tongue like a Listerine strip and I couldn't get it out. It was gross. I gave my remaining product to a co-worker who LOVES them. More for her! Thanks for the sample, though!"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexa J.,",06-Dec-18,"Personally, I did not care for Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks. I tried sea salt flavor. I thought they would be more like crisps, however they are more paper-like. They also had a bit of a fishy undertone, which makes sense since they are seaweed but I didn't expect it. I would not buy this product again, but I may recommend it to someone who likes this type of food."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephanie H.,",22-Jan-19,"i have never tried anything with seaweed in it, so i was a little hesitant on these but excited to try none the less. i really wanted to like these, but i just didn't. maybe if you're already a fan of seaweed, these are the snacks for you. i did like the flavoring to them, but i think it was the seaweed flavor that ruined it for me in the end."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie B.,",29-Oct-18,I just used the Sea Salt Halo organic seaweed snacks to snack on. I didn't care for them just because I'm not used to eating that type of food. I do like the fact they are organic and better for you than regular snacks. I'm sure other people might find them amazing.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracy D.,",11-Mar-19,It was not a pleasing flavor or texture in my opinion. Perhaps if I had tried an actual flavor & not just sea salt my opinion would be different. I was unable to find the other flavors at the store I went to though so I tried what they had. I will not be purchasing it again.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brinda V.,",30-Nov-18,I will say that this is definitely an acquired taste. Either you like it or not. I personally thought it was ok but don't think I will be buying any more anytime soon. My daughter on the other hand loves them. She eats them all day. Like I said it's an acquired taste.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Eileen T.,",30-Nov-18,I tried the Sea Salt Halo Seaweed Snacks. I did not like anything about the Seaweed Snacks. They were as thin a piece of paper. At first it just had a strong spinach like taste with salt. Then as you chewed it and it softened up a strong fishy taste emerged. Yuk! I never had any type of fish taste this fishy.
1,BARF!!!,"steve,",28-Jan-19,Don't listen to the others unless you like the taste of rotting fish. I had a tiny bite and almost barfed. My dogs wouldn't eat it at first then they did but they like whitefish dog food so maybe that's why I highly recommend not eating it but pranking friends into eating it.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Delta B.,",25-Nov-18,"I didn't like the texture or the taste that much. I tried other products like this in the past and I know it all natural and organic so I try to make myself like these types of products and I'm just not into it. What I mean by ""these types of products,"" is knowing that I'm actually eating seaweed. I've tried 2 other seaweed organic products sort of like HALO, but I can't get past the fact that its seaweed. I love organic items though, they're my favorite products because I know that there's no chemicals or pesticides and other added substances to make a product better tasting, but in all reality, it's not good for you. I love organic, but I will eat non-organic items as long as I read the ingredients and it's favorable to me. I will literally read every ingredient and the amount of vitamins, minerals, sugars, cholesterol, fats, etc in items that are new to me. I love trying new things, but I have to say I didn't necessarily enjoyed eating this. I didn't use the buy one get one coupons that were sent because I haven't used them yet. I intend to because it looks like there are different HALO products to try other than the seaweed one. I'm just giving my honest feedback, but others might enjoy this product. Thank you for letting me try this for free and the additional coupons that will be used in the future."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Crystal F.,",13-Jan-19,Organic Seaweed Snacks were not for me. I was hoping i would like it so i could include something naturally high in iodine into my diet but unfortunately i couldnt do it. Neither of my kids would eat it either... I have never had seaweed so it isnt the brand it is just the taste of seaweed.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"AMBER G.,",29-Nov-18,"I'd never tried anything like this before. I was rather skeptical at first, I didn't know how I'd feel about eating green seaweed lol. But I wanted to try these. I wasn't crazy about the texture, but the flavor wasn't bad. Although I appreciate the opportunity, I doubt I'll be buying these for myself any time soom."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"karolina P.,",29-Oct-18,I honestly could not find the seaweed snacks in any of the stores located in the flyer. And I even when out of town twice to look for the product and nothing. I ended up with the miso noodle bowl to test out and review and wasnt a fan. It tasted very bland. It was very much tasteless.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Angelle S.,",02-Dec-18,"I love the idea of the brand and the healthy ingredients Ocean Halo uses in their products. However, I personally did not enjoy the Halo seaweed snacks. I shared them with my household, but it was not received well either. I tried the vegan bacon flavor, the texture was interesting, and they sort of melt away in your mouth, but I just did not like the taste at all. They were pretty strong, and I could not get past the first bite. I will try to use them in a Miso soup and see if they will work better to compliment a dish rather than eaten on their own."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pat P.,",13-Dec-18,"I prepared the Miso Noodle Bowl, the exact way directions stated. Nowhere in the directions did it say when to add the soy. The noodles were not cooked enough at the required time so I cooked longer. The taste was not at all to my liking and i have had Miso soup in restaurants. I couldn't even eat it."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Omaimah G.,",01-Jan-19,"I tried the spicy noodles. The noodles were thick like spaghetti, and I didn't like the flavor of the broth. I was also disappointed by the small package of crushed red pepper ( maybe if it contained a couple of dried Thai peppers, it would have added a little heat)."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sascha W.,",25-Nov-18,"I tried the Miso Noodle Bowl and I was not impressed. It took a lot longer for the noodles to soften up than the directions suggested. It was bland, not that I expect miso soup to have a ton of flavor, but what flavor this one did have was slightly bitter. When I have miso soup I expect it to be savory and salty, and this just didn't do it for me. Also, it's a lot of packaging, and not much food for the price."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hollie S.,",27-Nov-18,"I was very curious to try these seaweed snacks. I thought maybe it could be a healthy go to snack. I was wrong. These things taste like your eating dried up fish skin. If you like sushi, you might like these, the taste is similar to the wrap of a sushi roll. It makes a lot of crumbs and just did not impress me."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lita N.,",09-Dec-18,"I've tried this product before in a different flavor (Sriracha), this time I tried Sea Salt (it was the only flavor in stock at my local grocery and I'm starting to see why) and I have to say that the flavor that I just tried wasn't exactly great in my opinion. Sure, one should be expecting much from a flavor like Sea Salt when it applies to something like sea weed, but this was by far the saltiest sea weed I've ever tried! I drank over half a bottle of water and still felt parched! I don't recommend eating this on its own. Adding it to ramen or maybe some kind of rice bowl is fine, but if you try to eat it on its own, expect to be chugging down to get the saltiness out of your mouth. The sea weed is very pronounced and is constantly at odds with the equally powerful sea salt flavor. Try it if you dare."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jami S.,",04-Jan-19,"I am on the fence on Ocean Halo Seaweed Snacks. I got the Sea Salt, and it wasn't what I expected. It tasted better than I thought it would, but it still wasn't something I would eat as a snack everyday. Maybe some of the other flavors would be more flavorful than the Sea Salt. It is a healthy alternative to other snacks, and if I go on a diet I might pick these over an unhealthy snack. Until then, I will keep my current snack."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda A.,",26-Oct-18,"I didn't like it at all. The seaweed tasted too fishy. As my sister said, "" it tastes like those fish food flakes I would sneak eat when I was a kid."" I couldn't even finish one of the chips. I don't like seafood though, so that may have been a factor in my displeasure."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vic W.,",18-Nov-18,"My daughter, husband,8year old granddaughter and I sat down while watching football to try the bacon and sea salt flavored seaweed chips. We liked the thin, crunchy texture and the fact that they were low-cal and good for you( you hear so much about the benefits of seaweed). We were expecting salty...like the ocean...,but we couldn't get past the fishy taste. The bacon ones were a bit better but after two or three everyone was overwhelmed by the fish taste. None of us would try them again even though we loved the health benefits and the light crunchiness."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kathryn M.,",12-Feb-19,They weren't bad per say just not my thing. My sister loved them. Of course she is the weird that always raw seaweed. It just wasn't my thing. I would definently suggest trying it if your curious. From my family's reactions it was either a gimme gimme more or No thank you. It's worth a shot.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"MegHan M.,",07-Dec-18,"the G.I. Joe and i tried some snacks. very well packaged for lunches. i thought the taste was meh. the G.I. Joe said ""i expected it to taste like the ones ive had from korea?, with a little more flavor and crunch."" i would have liked to try another flavor but this was the only one carried at my store"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen S.,",05-Dec-18,"The taste was too fishy for my liking. The store didn't have any other flavor than sea salt. Consistency was flaky but not much to crunch, I'd prefer a chip or cracker as a snack. Also seemed like excessive packaging for a single serving. Would not buy again"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Janette C.,",06-Dec-18,"These snacks weren't for me. The packaging is attractive and I was excited to #TryNatural, I just don't think I'm a seaweed snack kind of gal. I enjoy the @OceansHalo brand and will continue to purchase their broths and noodles! #GotItFree Thanks @SocialNature"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shaniqua W.,",22-Dec-18,I think that this product is probably one of the healthiest and best options for my diet right now but I could not get past the taste. I usually dont dabble in areas I'm not extremely familiar with but it was worth the try. I'll need to try a different recipe next time then maybe things will be better.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rita V.,",12-Dec-18,Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all. Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all. Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Trudie S.,",25-Feb-19,This product was really bad. I did not like the taste at all. It taste so bad I would never try another. This was not a good snack for anyone in my family
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashley G.,",25-Oct-18,"Im not a fan of seaweed. Although, I did try it. I'm still not a fan! But, that doesn't mean someone elae won't like it! #gotitforfree #worthatry @socialnature"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pat C.,",05-Nov-18,Delicious snack! I had the seaweed snacks in different flavors. I am quite a fan. They tasted good and are pretty healthy. My new go to for seaweed snacks.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sally G.,",30-Nov-18,"I thought this was the most disgusting snack I've ever had. I've had seaweed snacks before that I really enjoyed, but this had the fishiest taste that I couldn't even finish one. I will never get these again."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kalee W.,",25-Jan-19,This was something not for me. I am usually not a fan of oriental foods. I thought I may like it but just didn't. I will just stick to the regular maruchen ramen noodles for now.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Corina S.,",11-Mar-19,"I did not enjoy this product. The flavor was very salty and fishy, and the texture was dry. Price for the product was high as well. Overall it was not something I would buy again."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alice K.,",27-Feb-19,"I thought this organises weed wasn't not good , it tastes like fried green grass my kids didn't like it my friends didn't like it so sorry about this product had no taste"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"April O.,",02-Feb-19,My daughter and I love bacon but so we was excited to get to try Ocean's Halo bacon flavored seaweed snacks. We did not like them at all. In fact we thought it tasted pretty horrible.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer S.,",29-Nov-18,These were not for me. I did not like the taste and I did not like the texture. I had my husband and kids try it as well and they also did not like it.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sonya A.,",05-Dec-18,"It was gross, I tried the ramen, so sad! I was looking foryto it but it was more like spaghetti noodles with some weird broth! Yuck! I would not recommend them."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Taryn P.,",11-Mar-19,I was not a fan flavor or texture - was very hard to find in store. Tried the Sea Salt and it just wasn't a great experience. Too much hassle for something I wouldn't buy again.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heather-christina H.,",20-Dec-18,"Being a person that doesn't really like seafood, I should've known that I wouldn't have liked this product. Had a very fishy taste. Would recommend to individuals that live seafood and an ocean's taste but not for those who hate it"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kristen E.,",22-Jan-19,"I thought trying flavored seaweed might make me enjoy it more, but nope. I just can't get into the taste of these. If you like seaweed products, you will enjoy, but I did not."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Laura H.,",07-Dec-18,"It wasn't that great. Had a weird taste to it. I doubt I will try the other flavors. The texture was off putting to me, too. ................................"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Trina T.,",11-Nov-18,"Not really my cup of ""tea"" persay, I have been trying some organic foods here and there. Some I liked and some I did not. This was one of my dislikes, I don't know if it was that it was made from seaweed or the actual taste."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kristi C.,",28-Feb-19,"It was okay, nothing special...tasted fishy to my like it came right out of the sea.... it was extra salty too.. def would not be my choice if I got to choose"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kelly H.,",05-Jan-19,"I did like these snacks, although the taste is just a little too different for my liking. I might purchase something from this company, although would not purchase the seaweed snack again."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Melissa R.,",10-Feb-19,I didn't think they were very good I didn't like the texture or flavor. Too salty. I wouldn't recommend this product. But my granddaughter liked them. So go figure!
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarah D.,",31-Oct-18,"Unfortunately I am not a fan of these snacks. I love that they are healthy for my family, however no one liked them. Thank you so much for the opportunity."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maranda P.,",06-Dec-18,I have eaten nori on sushi wraps but I guess ive never had seaweed snacks before. These were tough to out down. Had a spoiled fish flavor that I could not get past. Maybe thats just me though.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Linda L.,",16-Nov-18,The seaweed snacks taste good but hard as heck to find in my area I wish more stores near me had the products. Was very frustrating trying to find them
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephanie B.,",11-Mar-19,"I have been searching for healthier snacks for the kids, but I think the texture was the first turn off. I didn't really find the taste very appealing. Maybe I can test other flavors in the future."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessica M.,",04-Nov-18,"I didn't know what to expect from these sea salt seaweed snacks,but now that I've tasted them,I wont do it again. I couldn't. I had to spit it out. These seaweed snacks are very light and flaky but do not taste good to me."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer V.,",06-Dec-18,"The ""bacon"" taste was the aftertaste, nothing like I expected. I was hoping for something to mask SOME of the seaweed taste but when I did get the ""bacon"" taste it was just a salty smokey flavor. It was ok, but not bacon."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Samantha C.,",23-Jan-19,i am not a fan of seaweed so i figured this might be different however i was not convinced. i did not like the texture or the flavor. i was a bit disappointed
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"chris C.,",26-Nov-18,We did not like it at all. It tasted like chili lime flavored fish. This was the worst thing I have ever attempted to eat. I am not sure if another flavor would be better or worse
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amy N.,",12-Nov-18,I didn't like these at all! They taste like fish which I do not like. I was hopeful the sriracha flavor would help but it does not. I like the nutritional info and the packaging. I just wish it tasted better.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Terri M.,",11-Nov-18,Not crazy about these. They may be healthy but not a fan. I could eat these if I had to but would choose other snacks first over these. Maybe I'll try another flavor and see if my opinion changes.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Aleksandra C.,",17-Feb-19,The taste of seaweed on its own was just too overpowering. It was a low calorie snack but not something I would ready for regularly. It was also very hard to find this at different stores.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pamela M.,",05-Dec-18,I am just not a fan at all. I didn't like the flavor at all. I tried to get past the initial shock of what I was trying but it didn't make things any better. I am glad I got to try it for free but I don't think that I will be purchasing anymore.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracie D.,",07-Dec-18,I was offered a sample to try It wasn't for me but probably other people might like it I just didn't like that taste nothing really to do with the product itself
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Denise D.,",07-Dec-18,"I chose the sea salt flavor because it sounded like it would be the best tasting, but myself and my family wasn't to fond of the texture. So now I'm going to try another Halo product."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Le'Sandra S.,",13-Jan-19,Was willing to try something new. It just wasn't for me. I couldn't get over the aftertaste. Not terrible but wouldn't do it again. I tried the bacon flavor.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alicia M.,",12-Nov-18,This is very likely to be blamed on the flavor. I was only able to find Sea Salt which really didn't mask any of the seaweed flavor for me. I would be willing to give it another go if I can find a better flavor.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alesha A.,",25-Jan-19,I think I might have been expecting something a little different. The Taste was terrible. It was more like taking I'm outside vitamin then having a snack.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"sweety P.,",15-Dec-18,I tried Sea Salt flavor... but it has a little taste that I didn't find pleasant... These just a very thin paper like sheets.... hence not filling like any other snack... I would like to try Sriracha or Wasabi flavor...
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ellery B.,",21-Nov-18,"This was not my cup of tea. I love all the aspects of this product, but am not a fan of the taste. This is definitely an acquired taste. If you like to try new things, this a very fun product to try."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christine T.,",25-Nov-18,I'm still trying to get this taste out of my mouth. It was fishy and overwhelming. This is not something that I would buy again or recommend to others.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lisa T.,",09-Jan-19,"It was very expensive but I still tried it! After trying it, the flavor wasn't very strong and I couldn't really taste it. I'd just as same use water."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessica P.,",19-Nov-18,"The lime flavor just wasnt for me. It didn't particularly care for the texture either. They were different and it was great to get the opportunity to try them. However, they just aren't for me."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"April M.,",23-Nov-18,i got these today and chose the bacon flavor. i have to say they were kind of strange and we didnt really like them. they were real salty which we usually like but these arent for us.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Yvonne A.,",06-Dec-18,I honestly I really didnt like it at all the texture was fine but the taste is not for me. So í won't be buying it again. Maybe the noodle bowls are better.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Melissa A.,",29-Nov-18,"I had high hopes for these seaweed snacks, but unfortunately they didn't live up to my expectations. With this being said, I am sure others would enjoy them. They just weren't for me."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sara W.,",21-Jan-19,"Not a big fan of the way this product tastes. I had high hopes, but this product just did not impress me. I will probably try other products by this brand."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"RACHEL F.,",08-Feb-19,I didn't like the seaweed at all. It tasted to me like rotten fish... I really wanted to like it too. I honestly wouldn't ever buy this and am glad i had a free sample first. I might try their other products.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Johnette G.,",08-Jan-19,"I am always looking for ways to curb snaking during the day. I was excited to try the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks, but for me they were not what I expected. It is definitely an acquired taste."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephen H.,",12-Jan-19,"Perhaps because there products do not move very rapidly I may have gotten one that was a bit stale, but I was not impressed with it. It had a rather non-descriptor flavor and texture. I personally would not go out of my way to try another one."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Zuly T.,",10-Nov-18,I did not like this stuff at all made me gag But my friends really enjoyed them and even got a few more packs they really enjoyed the bacon Flavored ones and they got a couple more packets
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christina H.,",17-Feb-19,I didn't purchase this product. I used all my coupons on the noodle bowls and the broth. I am not a huge seaweed fan and wanted to try the other products in this brand more than the seaweed snacks.

2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Noelle L.,",22-Nov-18,I'm a big fan of Ocean's Halo but not so much of the seaweed snack. With me it may be a mind over matter type of deal but I didn't like the taste or texture of these snacks

2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexandra G.,",10-Nov-18,"Very powerful flavor with the salt snack, they only had bacon flavor or salt. I thought they were a bit too mushy when you bit into them - I expected them to be more like kale ships."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jamie B.,",25-Feb-19,I was not a fan of the organic seaweed snacks by Ocean's Halo. The packaging was colorful and attractive but the product was just not enjoyable. It had a very fishy taste and smell and left a very unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Wanda(Lacey) H.,",18-Dec-18,This stuff is NASTY!! I couldn't get past the smell hardly!! There is no way I could or would recommend this product to anyone.

2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie Q.,",25-Nov-18,While out shopping for the Halo seaweed snacks I went to two stores and did not find the product. I was looking forward to trying a healthy snack. I did try there thai coconut broth. I made a lo mein with it. Better flavor than soy sauce.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michele W.,",16-Dec-18,I was not thrilled on the flavor of the sea salt seaweed chips. They were a little more bitter than I personally could stand. I think I may try another flavor like the Korean BBQ next.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shelly N.,",08-Jan-19,Not great. very fishy tasting and flavoring (bacon) was a dusting of powder. Was really unpleasant. I really like most all their other products.
