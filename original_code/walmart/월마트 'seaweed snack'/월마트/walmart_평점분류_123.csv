3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christina K.,",26-Dec-19,"I thought these seaweed snacks were okay; though a little salty for me. i would perhaps purchase another flavor, but not the seasalt again. Besides the saltiness, the seaweed itself tasted interesting. Very unique snack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Katie P.,",02-Mar-20,"This is a high-quality organic products with good ingredients. I liked that it has a little crisp to it, but it is just too chewy for me after the first crisp. If I'm going to have to gnaw on leaves for a while, if rather just eat a salad. I tried the sea salt, so maybe the other options would have a little more flavor that would make a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Megan M.,",16-Dec-19,"Well....I was very excited to try some of these products because I LOVE Asian food. Today I purchased the seaweed snacks and the ramen bowl. I was very eager to try it so I ripped it open as soon as I got into the car and put a piece into my mouth......And then I almost threw up immediately. I hate to sound dramatic but it's true. I'm not 100% sure if it was a texture thing or an actual taste thing but it was awful!! It took EVERYTHING in my power to not throw up in my car. I had to dig in my center console for a piece of gum to help get the taste out of my mouth. I am still looking forward to trying other products in this line, but the seaweed snacks are definitely not for me. I also purchased the wasabi flavor but I am TERRIFIED to try it.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"lorraine S.,",03-Mar-20,These were ok. I am not used to eating something like this. I see myself buying these for special occasions or to add to a meal or something of that nature. Maybe I should try all flavors because I can pair up to other foods options easier?

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Nicolette W.,",22-Dec-19,"I normally purchase another brand of seaweed snacks and was very open to trying another brand. I tried the sea salt kind since that is the kind I get when I but the other brand I normally eat. I found Halo's Ocean to be too salty for my liking and I could not even eat an entire pack. They had the same overall flavor, but extremely salty. I would only get them if I had a coupon or they are out of my normal brand, even though they are cheaper.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dawn A.,",03-Feb-20,okay i tried these and i thought i would like them but i truly didnt like the taste so i let my oldest son try it and he was like oh god no mom i told him it was like a chip and was healthier but he just didnt like the taste either [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hannah W.,",16-Dec-19,"I've never tried seaweed before, so i wasn't really sure what to expect with these snacks. I wasn't a fan, especially of the overwhelming salty fish taste. Someone who likes seaweed tried it though and he liked it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stefanie P.,",08-Jan-20,Me and my family tried the sea salt flavor of the Organic Seaweed Snacks. It was definitely something different and something we were a bit nervoys to try however it wasnt that bad. It was a bit too salty though. My sons didnt really like them and I dont believe they would be very filling for growing childrwn. I do however think if you are on some sort of weight loss regimen that these snacks may be a good snack to keep around. I woild recommend to friends and family. #trynatural #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer M.,",03-Mar-20,"These were VERY salty. The flavor was good but we couldn't eat more than a few at a time. The seaweed had a great texture, which most of these products do, but man .... I wasn't sure I was going to make it out with both of my kidneys. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Fardos K.,",22-Dec-19,It's not a product I would purchase or use again. I didn't care for the flavor or texture. It was an experience but not that I would want to repeat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christina D.,",04-Mar-20,I waz happy with the Free Product. The taste waa bland and I couldn't get my kids to try them. Seema a bit on the higher end of pricing as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracie-Ann D.,",11-Feb-20,It was ok not really my thing I didn't enjoy it but my sister tried it and loved it I think you need to just like the taste and texture of it this product to really enjoy it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"georgia S.,",24-Jan-20,Did not like this product did not enjoy the taste there was also too much sodium in this product. It's just not something that I would purchase [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashley F.,",24-Jan-20,I wasn't a big fan I really didnt like the flavor at all. I also don't like sea weed so that could also be the problem if you like seaweed you might actually like this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brenda B.,",19-Jan-20,I did not like the taste and the texture of the Seaweed snacks. It tasted fishy. I have liked the other Oceans Halo products that I have tried [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carol B.,",10-Jan-20,I liked how the product tasted. The variety and flavors of the products are great! I will most likely try the other variety of products available. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Patricia D.,",21-Feb-20,"I did not enjoy the taste or texture of this product so I do not recommend this product. It is on the pricy side also, and kind of hard to find in the store [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Wen L.,",01-Feb-20,"I thought flavor-wise it was pretty average. I like how it's organic, but it could have had more in terms of flavor. Cost isn't too bad, but I'm not sure if I would buy them on my own time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"larissa H.,",11-Dec-19,I tried the sea salt flavor and it tasted very similar to tortilla chips. I'm not sure why but I expected it to be sweeter. I also didn't like the after taste which is kinda like dirt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mya T.,",20-Jan-20,The Thai coconut milk curry was my favorite. It was easy and quick to make. It taste just like the restaurant. I didn't like the ramen noodle beowl. it was too dry for my taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"michael L.,",22-Jan-20,"It has a good crunch, not too salty with enough wasabi flavor. It was good as a snack it self or on top of rice. Good flavor. Going to try different one [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kasidy R.,",13-Jan-20,I tried it just like it came and it was good but not something I could eat all the time. Others might love it so much that they eat it everyday or even put it in their cooking. Just have to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Staci B.,",17-Jan-20,"I tried the bbq flavor it was ok. I didn't care for the texture however, I liked the crispness and crunch of the product but I don't think i would replace for a fresh vegetable not a huge fan sorry [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Katharine W.,",03-Mar-20,I tried the pho soup kit. It was incredibly salty and kind of bland. I make better pho broth than this and would not buy it as a quick meal. I would rather make my own from scratch or go out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Patricia C.,",30-Jan-20,"They were nasty. After the first crunch they turned slimy and tasted like fish. I was not a fan of those and neither was my son, and he likes sushi. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vanessa M.,",14-Nov-19,So ill personally never buy this product again the after taste was horrible it went down easy. But not something I'd recommend to anyone the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because it looks nice. Just doesn't taste good at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashlie H.,",08-Dec-19,I thought the Ocean's Halo seaweed snack was okay. To me it tasted like greens but a lot more salty. It is a lot thinner that I thought it would be. It's a good snack but it's just not for me. I could eat it on occasion but it wouldn't be my first choice. I think it's an acquired taste. It would be a nice healthy snack for someone who loves seaweed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"AnneMarie D.,",26-Nov-19,A little salty as a snack.I think they would be best on top of soup.I would make a tofu or miso soup and crumble the sheet on top.I had trouble locating tofu so it took me a while to make the soup I also use the broth and think it would be best with oriental vegetables.trynatural# [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
1,Gross,"Mace,",01-Jul-20,"this tastes like lakewater, like you just swallowed a lakewater."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jolyn W.,",07-Dec-19,"These snacks were not a favorite for me. The taste was ok, but nothing I would go out of my way to buy. The sea salt flavor was amazing, but the texture sort of threw me off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tara F.,",18-Nov-19,"I bought these because I got the coupons. My family had never tried them. Turned out they didnt like them. But,it was worth it to try them. Y ok u never know. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarah G.,",07-Nov-18,These Ocean Halos Organic Seaweed Snacks were alright for a snack. The texture was a little weird for me along with the taste. I guess it is something i would have to get used to as a healthy snack alternative. I picked up Korean BBQ and i wish their was more flavor with these snacks.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Meagan B.,",24-Nov-18,I am already not a fan if seaweed but Love sushi so I was excited to give this a try. I got the bacon flavor. The flavor was ok but the sheets could have been in smaller size where you just pick and eat. After 2 pieces I threw this product away because the fishy taste was so bad I could not take it anymore and this is coming from someone who is not a picky eater all and loves fish as well.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carline O.,",29-Oct-18,"The chili lime seaweed snacks were definitely a first for me. I didn't quite know what to expect. It has an interesting flavor to it, but not in a bad way. I liked trying it out, but I think I would have to eat a few more to get accustomed to the flavor."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracy W.,",28-Nov-18,"I was given an opportunity to try Organic Seaweed Snacks through Social Nature in exchange for my honest review. I haven't tried many of the organic products on the market. The snacks were not too bad. I tried the Sea Salt flavor. It had a nice, salty taste but not too salty. The texture was a little bit of a problem for me. I felt like I was eating seaweed lol. But that could of been all in my head. I'm particular about texture so it may not be a problem for others. The seaweed is ocean-farmed and I liked that it is sustainable and that the company cares about that."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heather F.,",25-Nov-18,"I didn't really enjoy these. I got the sea salt variety but the overall flavor just wasn't for me. It left a weird after taste. I didn't enjoy the texture either. I'm looking forward to trying other products from this brand, however. This one just wasn't for me. #GotItFree"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kat G.,",25-Nov-18,I was intrigued when i opened the package. Ive has sushi before so i knew I liked seaweed. I thought i would like the crunchy texture and i did. But I didnt like the flavor at all. I had the seaweed one and it just tasted like sour salty green stuff. I wouldn't buy it again. I just didn't care for the flavor.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"nic S.,",15-Nov-18,I received this product via Free coupon in exchange for my honest review from social nature. While I was very excited to try this product I wasn't very pleased with its taste. I choose the sea salt flavor because I thought it was safe. I am not a huge sea food fan; in fact most sea food makes me sick to my stomach. This smelled salty and tasted like salted algae(sp). I actually had to run to the trash can after kinda chewing it because I almost threw up in my mouth. If you like fish or shrimp you'll probably like this but its not for me. I'd still like to give some of their other products a try but I will never touch seaweed again. LOL
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ruthelle L.,",13-Jan-19,"I got the sea salt organic seaweed snacks. The seaweed sheets are very thin. I tried one by just eating it by itself. I was not very fond of the taste or aftertaste. So I decided to give it another try and had some with white rice. This taste was much better when I had it wrapped around the rice. However, the aftertaste still wasn't pleasant for me. So sadly I wouldn't purchase this specific product again because I didn't like the lingering aftertaste."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen M.,",11-Nov-18,"I tried the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks Sea Salt flavor and was not impressed. First, they are see- through thin and they're a size that is too big to fit the whole sheet in your mouth, but when you try to just bite a piece off or fold it in half they break and crumble. And I'm not a fan of seafood at all so maybe that's why I didn't like the taste or smell. Maybe a stronger flavor like wasabi or sriracha would mask the sea smell better and make them more edible to me."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Samantha G.,",28-Jan-19,"I was absolutely not the audience for these seaweed things. I put one in my mouth and it got stuck to my tongue like a Listerine strip and I couldn't get it out. It was gross. I gave my remaining product to a co-worker who LOVES them. More for her! Thanks for the sample, though!"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexa J.,",06-Dec-18,"Personally, I did not care for Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks. I tried sea salt flavor. I thought they would be more like crisps, however they are more paper-like. They also had a bit of a fishy undertone, which makes sense since they are seaweed but I didn't expect it. I would not buy this product again, but I may recommend it to someone who likes this type of food."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mellisa S.,",31-Oct-18,"The seaweed snacks we're okay. Not my typical snack but I would eat it again, my kids didn't like the flavor I chose. I made ramen with the noodles and broth, my kids loved it! It wasn't too mush and had a great flavor. Overall I will purchase these products again in the future."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephanie H.,",22-Jan-19,"i have never tried anything with seaweed in it, so i was a little hesitant on these but excited to try none the less. i really wanted to like these, but i just didn't. maybe if you're already a fan of seaweed, these are the snacks for you. i did like the flavoring to them, but i think it was the seaweed flavor that ruined it for me in the end."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sara R.,",24-Dec-18,"I enjoy trying new things, so was excited to try this alternative to chips. It has a Very strong taste of seaweed, an ocean fishy taste. The amount of salt was a good ratio on them though. I ate them just by themselves, but I could see using it in a recipe where I would use spinich or kale. Otherwise, I would not eat it just raw."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Danielle H.,",16-Nov-18,"I wasn't sure if I would like these. I don't mind seaweed in sushi or sometimes mixed in with soups and other things. I picked the bacon flavor, which had a nice bacon taste to it. They still had a strong seaweed flavor, which isn't surprising, but they were just a little too much for me. I think these are a great quality and if you like seaweed snacks I think you would like these."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Debbie B.,",29-Oct-18,I just used the Sea Salt Halo organic seaweed snacks to snack on. I didn't care for them just because I'm not used to eating that type of food. I do like the fact they are organic and better for you than regular snacks. I'm sure other people might find them amazing.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jasmine M.,",29-Oct-18,"I received my coupons from Social Nature to try the Halo seaweed snacks for free. It had a very strong fishy taste. I have eaten seaweed before, I just don't remember it tasting that strong. I still have the buy one get one free coupon which I may try one of the Ramen products."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracy D.,",11-Mar-19,It was not a pleasing flavor or texture in my opinion. Perhaps if I had tried an actual flavor & not just sea salt my opinion would be different. I was unable to find the other flavors at the store I went to though so I tried what they had. I will not be purchasing it again.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brinda V.,",30-Nov-18,I will say that this is definitely an acquired taste. Either you like it or not. I personally thought it was ok but don't think I will be buying any more anytime soon. My daughter on the other hand loves them. She eats them all day. Like I said it's an acquired taste.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Daneilia F.,",06-Dec-18,I'd never tried seaweed before so I was very nervous to try. I'm glad I tried it. It was a very interesting flavor and texture. I can't say that I didn't like it but I can't say I did. Maybe if I got a different flavor I would have enjoyed it more. I plan on buying some of the other flavors to try and see if I like any of those better.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessa T.,",07-Jan-19,"I am not the biggest fan of dried seaweed, but I figured I would give this a shot. As predicted, it is very salty (but what seaweed isn't?). The Bacon flavor was not as prevalent as I would have liked, but for a dried seaweed fan, I'm sure this is a perfectly acceptable snack. The price point was very affordable, which was nice. I definitely want to try some of the other Ocean's Halo products."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"amanda H.,",31-Oct-18,"We got the ramen bowl kit, and I have to say it just was not our thing. It wasn't inedible, the noodles were great, we just did not like the broth. You can very much tell it is kelp/seaweed based. We would much prefer a chicken/beef base. However for someone who is more in to that seaweed flavor profile in a soup, it would probably be great."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Julianne D.,",04-Nov-18,"The Sushi Nori Sheets are packed with Vitamin B12 and Iodine! Personally, I do not particularly enjoy the taste of seaweed. It is alright, but not something I would buy. If I were to buy seaweed, I think Ocean's Halo is one of the better brands because it is completely natural with no additives. It is very expensive though for the smallness, and the lightness of seaweed."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer B.,",05-Nov-18,"I tried the Oceans Halo seaweed snacks in sea salt flavor. I did like the overall experience I had with the product, but I wish I could have found the flavors The product was also a bit hard to locate in my area. I hope to try the flavors with my coupons I received in the mail as well. Texas bbq sounds so good!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lavonne A.,",08-Jan-19,The only reason I am not giving a higher rating is my store only carried the chili lime flavor. I am not the biggest fan of that one. I prefer the Sea Salt option. This was a good snack. They are easy to toss in your lunch bag for on a salad or just to eat alone. I prefer to use them in salads. The lime flavor comes through on this chili lime one. On the sea salt ones I like the saltiness of them.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lorraine G.,",15-Nov-18,I thought that it was a good snack. Not the best since it had an after taste. It's good for when you need a quick snack on the go and you're hungry. I would recommend to those who enjoy eating healthy and don't mind the after taste. It is missing something but I'm not exactly sure what that is.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Brooke A.,",27-Nov-18,I'm not a big fan or nori snacks but I do like it in sushi. This wasn't terrible but Inalso didn't love it either. I did like the saltyness and the crunch but I just couldn't get I've the string nori taste. I'm sore if the store I got it from had other flavors it would have been better. I would try another flavor.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Eileen T.,",30-Nov-18,I tried the Sea Salt Halo Seaweed Snacks. I did not like anything about the Seaweed Snacks. They were as thin a piece of paper. At first it just had a strong spinach like taste with salt. Then as you chewed it and it softened up a strong fishy taste emerged. Yuk! I never had any type of fish taste this fishy.
1,BARF!!!,"steve,",28-Jan-19,Don't listen to the others unless you like the taste of rotting fish. I had a tiny bite and almost barfed. My dogs wouldn't eat it at first then they did but they like whitefish dog food so maybe that's why I highly recommend not eating it but pranking friends into eating it.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Delta B.,",25-Nov-18,"I didn't like the texture or the taste that much. I tried other products like this in the past and I know it all natural and organic so I try to make myself like these types of products and I'm just not into it. What I mean by ""these types of products,"" is knowing that I'm actually eating seaweed. I've tried 2 other seaweed organic products sort of like HALO, but I can't get past the fact that its seaweed. I love organic items though, they're my favorite products because I know that there's no chemicals or pesticides and other added substances to make a product better tasting, but in all reality, it's not good for you. I love organic, but I will eat non-organic items as long as I read the ingredients and it's favorable to me. I will literally read every ingredient and the amount of vitamins, minerals, sugars, cholesterol, fats, etc in items that are new to me. I love trying new things, but I have to say I didn't necessarily enjoyed eating this. I didn't use the buy one get one coupons that were sent because I haven't used them yet. I intend to because it looks like there are different HALO products to try other than the seaweed one. I'm just giving my honest feedback, but others might enjoy this product. Thank you for letting me try this for free and the additional coupons that will be used in the future."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Zandra L.,",05-Dec-18,"Wasn't a fan of the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks. I tried the bacon flavor and didn't notice any bacon taste whatsoever. I did like that these are a healthy and very affordable, organic snack alternative, however, I really dislike seafood and these taste very fishy to me, as do most seaweed products. If you enjoy seaweed foods though, I think these may be a great snack for you, but they were a pass for me!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Randi N.,",26-Nov-18,"I wish I could have tried something other than sea salt because it ended up being too salty for me to enjoy. I figured since I like sushi that the nori snacks would also be as tasty, and perhaps the other flavors are but my store only had the sea salt ones and I wasn't a fan, but my fiance liked them."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Crystal F.,",13-Jan-19,Organic Seaweed Snacks were not for me. I was hoping i would like it so i could include something naturally high in iodine into my diet but unfortunately i couldnt do it. Neither of my kids would eat it either... I have never had seaweed so it isnt the brand it is just the taste of seaweed.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lisa C.,",15-Nov-18,"I tried the bacon flavor. It tasted like regular seaweed snacks that I've had before with a mild bacon flavor. Not bad, but I looked at the ingredients AFTER I tried it & I found maltodextrin listed. Not what I want to see in what is supposed to be a healthy snack! Next time I try another flavor."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"AMBER G.,",29-Nov-18,"I'd never tried anything like this before. I was rather skeptical at first, I didn't know how I'd feel about eating green seaweed lol. But I wanted to try these. I wasn't crazy about the texture, but the flavor wasn't bad. Although I appreciate the opportunity, I doubt I'll be buying these for myself any time soom."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"brandy A.,",15-Nov-18,"I thought the product was pretty good but I just couldn't get into it being a food for me on the regular., I did however think that the value of this product was really good and I don't think that people are going to be disappointed if they are into this kind of product.. I will however definitely tell my friends and family about it and let them check it out themselves..."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kelly K.,",14-Nov-18,I was really hoping to try the bacon flavor but I was only able to find the Sea salt in my local store. And to be honest it was a bit to salty. They might be better if you have them with something else. But they are to salty by themselves. I did like the underlining flavor of the seaweed. I intend to check other stores for the other flavors to try.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alexis W.,",25-Jan-19,Perhaps I should have have tried a different flavor. I received this product in exchange for my honest review and tried the sea salt flavor. I found the salty flavor a bit too salty and again because it is seaweed perhaps sea salt was not the wisest choice. The texture was good and it was nice and crisp. I may try this product again in the future but I will select a different flavor. #trynatural #gotitfree
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"karolina P.,",29-Oct-18,I honestly could not find the seaweed snacks in any of the stores located in the flyer. And I even when out of town twice to look for the product and nothing. I ended up with the miso noodle bowl to test out and review and wasnt a fan. It tasted very bland. It was very much tasteless.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Angelle S.,",02-Dec-18,"I love the idea of the brand and the healthy ingredients Ocean Halo uses in their products. However, I personally did not enjoy the Halo seaweed snacks. I shared them with my household, but it was not received well either. I tried the vegan bacon flavor, the texture was interesting, and they sort of melt away in your mouth, but I just did not like the taste at all. They were pretty strong, and I could not get past the first bite. I will try to use them in a Miso soup and see if they will work better to compliment a dish rather than eaten on their own."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pat P.,",13-Dec-18,"I prepared the Miso Noodle Bowl, the exact way directions stated. Nowhere in the directions did it say when to add the soy. The noodles were not cooked enough at the required time so I cooked longer. The taste was not at all to my liking and i have had Miso soup in restaurants. I couldn't even eat it."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Omaimah G.,",01-Jan-19,"I tried the spicy noodles. The noodles were thick like spaghetti, and I didn't like the flavor of the broth. I was also disappointed by the small package of crushed red pepper ( maybe if it contained a couple of dried Thai peppers, it would have added a little heat)."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"heather C.,",06-Dec-18,I really wanted to like the Oceans Halo seaweed snacks. I figured the sea salt is a safe bet. They were just okay. I wasn't overly impressed. I tried them plain and then again added to a salad. They were better when added to my salad. I don't think I would purchase these.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Beth G.,",18-Nov-18,"The texture was very nice, it was very light and airy. I liked the thin crispness. The sea salt flavor was very salty in a really good way. The salt was very good. I would really like these, but I don't like the taste of nori. It tastes really fishy to me. The bacon flavor only seemed to add to the fishyness. The sea salt one starts out tasting really good, but then the salt melts away and if tastes like fish. These are almost good."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Asia G.,",24-Nov-18,"I was expecting something flavorful considering the flavors I've chosen, but I was sadly disappointed. I came into this testing with optimism and positivity, so I could give an open and honest review. It was either bland, not spicy enough, too salty or taste nothing like the flavor I chose. The healthy version of these snacks didn't meet my standards."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"natasha B.,",25-Feb-19,I received a free sample of the new Ocean's Halo seaweed snack from #SocialNature to try and it wasn't for me some of my friends liked it and I still told people about them but the taste wasn't something I enjoyed everything is not for everyone I've always wanted to try seaweed for a while so I thought this would be perfect but I just don't like them the texture of them wasn't for me either but like I said but you might love them plus maybe it was just the flavor I got #TryNatural #GotItFree
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dane H.,",06-Dec-18,"We couldn't find many of the Ocean's Halo products, so I'd say that's my biggest negative. We really wanted to try to ramen bowls, but they're not at local grocery stores. (we tried 5 different stores). In the end we ended up just grabbing the seaweed snacks in the Korean BBQ flavor. These aren't a snack I would typically gravitate too, however they did taste decent."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Emily B.,",24-Nov-18,"I didn't really like the texture or taste, but that's probably just because this product wasn't for me. I never really liked seaweed but wanted to try a new flavor. I still didn't really like it. I think others would like it though, if this is something you're into!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Misty B.,",28-Nov-18,"I bought these seaweed snacks as a healthy snack for my littles and myself. While they were decent in flavor, I just couldn't get past the texture of them. I love seaweed salad and am always willing to try new things, these just weren't for me. I'll pdobably try again and I've already recommended them to a few friends. Love oceans halo and their products!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sascha W.,",25-Nov-18,"I tried the Miso Noodle Bowl and I was not impressed. It took a lot longer for the noodles to soften up than the directions suggested. It was bland, not that I expect miso soup to have a ton of flavor, but what flavor this one did have was slightly bitter. When I have miso soup I expect it to be savory and salty, and this just didn't do it for me. Also, it's a lot of packaging, and not much food for the price."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Hollie S.,",27-Nov-18,"I was very curious to try these seaweed snacks. I thought maybe it could be a healthy go to snack. I was wrong. These things taste like your eating dried up fish skin. If you like sushi, you might like these, the taste is similar to the wrap of a sushi roll. It makes a lot of crumbs and just did not impress me."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Chris W.,",10-Nov-18,"We tried the sea salt first.. and my husband was the first to try (we have never had seaweed snacks before) and he was not impressed. His words were it tastes like a fish tank smells.. me personally thought it was pretty grassy. The bacon flavor was a bit better and gave a hit of better that a fish tank. All in all I know some really liked them, and I will recommend others try them out, but for us.. we will pass."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Haru B.,",15-Nov-18,"To start off, the seaweed snack, in general, are not for everyone. Some people just do not like seaweed snacks. I do prefer them and think that these are a very good option. The consistency and flavor are as advertised but a few pieces were stale like for some reason. Overall, this product meets expectations, I would recommend it!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jen M.,",08-Nov-18,"I was really excited to try these. This was my first experience trying a seaweed snack, I tried the sea salt flavor. I have to say it wasn't my favorite snack, the texture was a little strange to me and I didn't love the flavor. It has nothing to do with the Brand, seaweed snacks are just not for me!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lita N.,",09-Dec-18,"I've tried this product before in a different flavor (Sriracha), this time I tried Sea Salt (it was the only flavor in stock at my local grocery and I'm starting to see why) and I have to say that the flavor that I just tried wasn't exactly great in my opinion. Sure, one should be expecting much from a flavor like Sea Salt when it applies to something like sea weed, but this was by far the saltiest sea weed I've ever tried! I drank over half a bottle of water and still felt parched! I don't recommend eating this on its own. Adding it to ramen or maybe some kind of rice bowl is fine, but if you try to eat it on its own, expect to be chugging down to get the saltiness out of your mouth. The sea weed is very pronounced and is constantly at odds with the equally powerful sea salt flavor. Try it if you dare."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jami S.,",04-Jan-19,"I am on the fence on Ocean Halo Seaweed Snacks. I got the Sea Salt, and it wasn't what I expected. It tasted better than I thought it would, but it still wasn't something I would eat as a snack everyday. Maybe some of the other flavors would be more flavorful than the Sea Salt. It is a healthy alternative to other snacks, and if I go on a diet I might pick these over an unhealthy snack. Until then, I will keep my current snack."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sandra G.,",28-Oct-18,I am giving Ocean's Halo seaweed snack 3 stars. The snack is paper thin and pretty much melts on your tongue. It is slightly fishy tasting which was a turn off for me altogether. I will say that I purchased 2 different flavors. The sea salt which was most fishy. Also the bacon which was not quite as fishy and the bacon canceled it out. My son and husband also tried it and they both liked it. My son said it reminded him slightly of sushi which he is also a fan of and I am not. My son preferred the sea salt and my husband preferred the bacon. They would probably give it a 5. In fact while at the store today my son bought 2 more. I guess you will have to try it for yourself. If I had to choose a favorite it would be the bacon.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Abigail V.,",04-Dec-18,"I tried the sea salt seaweed snack, and they sure do have a strong taste! I'd never tried seaweed snacks before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. They definitely have a strong fishy smell and taste, so not for the faint of heart or taste buds. Overall, they were a fun snack to try, but not something that I would purchase again."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda A.,",26-Oct-18,"I didn't like it at all. The seaweed tasted too fishy. As my sister said, "" it tastes like those fish food flakes I would sneak eat when I was a kid."" I couldn't even finish one of the chips. I don't like seafood though, so that may have been a factor in my displeasure."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cari C.,",15-Nov-18,Wasnt tpp impressee with the halo product. It was the wasabi. Just not something I would get again and eat again. It's actually not a bad price and it's perfect for people who like asian food. I will have to try another product by halo and see if I like it better. Maybe a different flavor. I wouod recommend it to people who like that kind of stuff. I'm glad I tried it though.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Morgan H.,",11-Dec-18,"I got the Texas BBQ flavor, and I'm not sure I liked it. I think it was the texture more than the flavor - because the flavor wasn't too bad! I am not used to seaweed, actually I think this may have been the first time I've eaten it. But I would give it a try again!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Miranda J.,",26-Oct-18,"These were pretty good. I tried the Korean BBQ flavor and the taste was definitely there- you still get that briny ocean flavor too. These are good for on the go and a great afternoon snack. The texture is really good, it can be difficult to get over the strong oceanic flavor in the background."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sheena B.,",05-Nov-18,It's a salty snack other than chips. The saltiness is good. The texture is kind of fun. My niece and nephew will eat them. It wasnt my favorite. I thought it had a weird taste. But compared to other healthier salty snacks. I would choose those. I might try another flavor.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maria B.,",13-Nov-18,"Not a big fan of seaweed, have heard of health benefit, This was better than most I have tried inthis snack variety though Although the other flavor was great and you could tastet teh difference (we bought two kinds) the taste of the sea weed overall is just something I cannot get over. I had a friend I recommended ittoo and she did ike it though."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Susanne B.,",16-Feb-19,"I used the vegetable broth in a mushroom and onion stir fry and it gave it a richer flavor than simply using olive oil and salt. Since I am staying away from dairy, soy and gluten this product seems to agree with my digestive system which is always a great thing! I would have liked a bit stronger flavor since I don't use a lot of other spices so look forward to trying some of the other products."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Vic W.,",18-Nov-18,"My daughter, husband,8year old granddaughter and I sat down while watching football to try the bacon and sea salt flavored seaweed chips. We liked the thin, crunchy texture and the fact that they were low-cal and good for you( you hear so much about the benefits of seaweed). We were expecting salty...like the ocean...,but we couldn't get past the fishy taste. The bacon ones were a bit better but after two or three everyone was overwhelmed by the fish taste. None of us would try them again even though we loved the health benefits and the light crunchiness."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kathryn M.,",12-Feb-19,They weren't bad per say just not my thing. My sister loved them. Of course she is the weird that always raw seaweed. It just wasn't my thing. I would definently suggest trying it if your curious. From my family's reactions it was either a gimme gimme more or No thank you. It's worth a shot.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"MeLisa A.,",07-Dec-18,"I enjoy seaweed snacks. They're a great snack that fits Perfectly with my dietary needs. The Ocean's Halo seaweed snacks had ok flavor and were just a little on the chewy side for me. I would maybe still buy these considering the price, but I prefer other brands."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"MegHan M.,",07-Dec-18,"the G.I. Joe and i tried some snacks. very well packaged for lunches. i thought the taste was meh. the G.I. Joe said ""i expected it to taste like the ones ive had from korea?, with a little more flavor and crunch."" i would have liked to try another flavor but this was the only one carried at my store"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Laura H.,",13-Jan-19,"It was not bad. They were hard for me to obtain, but they tasted ok. I got the sea salt variety which would probably been better if i wasnt such a confirmed poopato chip addict. They were crunchy and visually appealing. A co worker absolutely loved them. I personally wont be purchasing them."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen S.,",05-Dec-18,"The taste was too fishy for my liking. The store didn't have any other flavor than sea salt. Consistency was flaky but not much to crunch, I'd prefer a chip or cracker as a snack. Also seemed like excessive packaging for a single serving. Would not buy again"
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Janette C.,",06-Dec-18,"These snacks weren't for me. The packaging is attractive and I was excited to #TryNatural, I just don't think I'm a seaweed snack kind of gal. I enjoy the @OceansHalo brand and will continue to purchase their broths and noodles! #GotItFree Thanks @SocialNature"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maya W.,",12-Nov-18,"I redeemed the coupon for the Sushi Nori Full Seaweed Sheets, as the store I visited only had the Bacon and Sea Salt flavors available in the Seaweed Snacks and I wanted the Chili Lime flavor. I decided to try and make authentic sushi rice rolls, so I chose the full sheets. The packaging made it easy to find in the store and was relatively easy to open while remaining sturdy enough to protect the product. I was pleased with the number of seaweed sheets that came in the package and all of them were in good condition and were not dry or crumbly. When it came to the taste, I was not so pleased. I felt as though the sheets could use a lot more flavor. I offered a sheet to one of my coworkers, who also enjoys seaweed, and he felt similarly. It tasted fairly bland either by itself or with rice and filling, to the point where I had to add my own seasoning. Suggestions: I would have liked to see a vegan label on the Bacon variety, as the reason I passed it up was because I believed that animal products were used when that is not the case. It would also be nice to see the sushi nori sheets available in the same flavors as the snack sheets. I will likely try the seasoned varieties if I am able to find them in the store."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Miranda R.,",04-Mar-19,"Personally, I did not enjoy the taste of the sea salt seaweed snacks. They had a very fishy taste, and considering I'm not a huge fan of seafood, I did not find them particularly enjoyable. However, if you are a fan of seafood, I could definitely see how one could enjoy these. Inexpensive, worth a try!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shaniqua W.,",22-Dec-18,I think that this product is probably one of the healthiest and best options for my diet right now but I could not get past the taste. I usually dont dabble in areas I'm not extremely familiar with but it was worth the try. I'll need to try a different recipe next time then maybe things will be better.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sonya F.,",31-Oct-18,"I didn't know what to expect, being skeptical about eating seaweed. It was just okay and I wouldn't voluntarily buy seaweed snacks again. The Korean and Texas BBQ, Maui Onion and Sriracha are great flavors and tasted great but each time I chewed a piece I couldn't help but visual dirty ocean water near the shore with even filthier foam and seaweed touching the sand."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tammy W.,",26-Nov-18,"We tried the bacon flavor because let's be honest, who doesn't love bacon?? I was hesitant as its seaweed and not a normal staple in our household but boy am I glad we tried this product . It was deliciously flavored, had the perfect crunch and get this...my kids loved them!!"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rita V.,",12-Dec-18,Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all. Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all. Not for me. I do not like the taste or texture at all.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashley C.,",26-Nov-18,The product was okay. The only one I liked was the sea salt. I would purchase those again. The Wasabi did not have a good flavor at all. The Texas bbq was alright but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Candy S.,",25-Feb-19,"I didn't care for them but my family liked them.they have had me buy them again to try other flavors.i will buy again for my family,and recommend them to others."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Talli K.,",10-Dec-18,This was a different kind of snack for me. I loved the taste. I took them in my lunch and it was a perfect addition. I would totally buy these again and have my family eat them regularly.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shannon D.,",22-Jan-19,"The Halo's seaweed snack was very different, it had a good taste but a weird texture or something. Overall they're ok but different. Not really my kind of snack."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Trudie S.,",25-Feb-19,This product was really bad. I did not like the taste at all. It taste so bad I would never try another. This was not a good snack for anyone in my family
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sherna L.,",15-Feb-19,You have to acquire a taste for this but once you do it does add a unique flavor to otherwise bland foods. I tried it on my scrambled eggs in pl ace of salt
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kaitlin S.,",20-Nov-18,I typically do not consume seaweed snacks those these were good compared to ones that I've had before. I do like the flavor selection because it's very varied.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heidi K.,",31-Oct-18,I was staying positive and was nervous about trying seaweed snacks. They were better than I thought but not something I would be interesting in buying on a regular basis.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kristi K.,",01-Nov-18,I enjoyed this organic seaweed snack but it was a little to dry for my liking. I love the many varieties that are available. I recommend this to anyone that loves real %100 all natural products.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Nora M.,",06-Dec-18,"First thought of putting seaweed in my mouth was not a good one...lol...but it didnt taste as bad your think (or I would anyway) texture was ,to me, like a fruit roll up and was ok to my taste."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dale W.,",18-Nov-18,I would definitely try a different flavor. Can't say I'm crazy about the texture. I probably won't buy again. I can't see anyone in my family wanting more.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"joanne R.,",22-Jan-19,I didnt care for it. I didnt know what it would taste like but I was surprised by the flavor. I guess that I am not as adventeurous as I thought. Maybe this item is for a younger person.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ashley G.,",25-Oct-18,"Im not a fan of seaweed. Although, I did try it. I'm still not a fan! But, that doesn't mean someone elae won't like it! #gotitforfree #worthatry @socialnature"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pat C.,",05-Nov-18,Delicious snack! I had the seaweed snacks in different flavors. I am quite a fan. They tasted good and are pretty healthy. My new go to for seaweed snacks.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elisabeth V.,",17-Jan-19,"The Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks were okay. I enjoyed the variety of flavors, but I just couldn't get into them like I would a potato chip or other salty snack. For me, they were not addicting. Try and see--to each his own."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sally G.,",30-Nov-18,"I thought this was the most disgusting snack I've ever had. I've had seaweed snacks before that I really enjoyed, but this had the fishiest taste that I couldn't even finish one. I will never get these again."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karissa O.,",05-Dec-18,"I felt like the sea salt flavor was too salty, and I really didn't care for the texture. My husband tried them and felt the same way. I'm still excited to try their other products, though!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tonna S.,",05-Nov-18,These were definitely not like anything I've ever eaten. It was different to say the least. I'm not sure it this will ever be a go to as a snack but some people may like it.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kalee W.,",25-Jan-19,This was something not for me. I am usually not a fan of oriental foods. I thought I may like it but just didn't. I will just stick to the regular maruchen ramen noodles for now.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Melissa F.,",15-Dec-18,I did not like the taste in the beginning. I tried a few more and it grew on me. I was surprised I ate the whole bag. It is a great snack you can take on the go.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Corina S.,",11-Mar-19,"I did not enjoy this product. The flavor was very salty and fishy, and the texture was dry. Price for the product was high as well. Overall it was not something I would buy again."

1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"April O.,",02-Feb-19,My daughter and I love bacon but so we was excited to get to try Ocean's Halo bacon flavored seaweed snacks. We did not like them at all. In fact we thought it tasted pretty horrible.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Betty S.,",07-Dec-18,It was pretty good just not enough of it will try others.there was not enough bacon flavor.I want to try the Korean BBQ next time.I do not know about the other yet.It makes a pretty good snack for when you are in a hurry.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer S.,",29-Nov-18,These were not for me. I did not like the taste and I did not like the texture. I had my husband and kids try it as well and they also did not like it.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michelle F.,",25-Feb-19,"I haven't found these in my local store yet but keep looking! They look delicious and like the perfect healthy snack! As soon as I find them, I will try them - I hope to find Sae Salt!!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Denecia F.,",04-Feb-19,I thought the snack was an interesting concept. Certainly different than any snack I would just grab on my way to work. The crunch was nice when I was craving chips and the flavors are awesome. I had the bacon flavor and it did not disappoint!
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rita R.,",08-Jan-19,Not quite the texture I was expecting but once I got over that it was pretty good. I think the salt hides the flavor of the seaweed well while not being too overpowering.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kathy W.,",25-Jan-19,"It was ok. It is not a product I would normally buy. However, it was better tasting than I expected. I did like the sea salt flavor. I would not purchase it again though."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rebecca T.,",01-Feb-19,Organic Seaweed Snacks we're good however the store I purchased them from did not have the flavor I wanted. I picked up the chili lime seaweed snacks as they were the only option. The seaweed snacks were great I'm not a fan of lime flavor though.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sonya A.,",05-Dec-18,"It was gross, I tried the ramen, so sad! I was looking foryto it but it was more like spaghetti noodles with some weird broth! Yuck! I would not recommend them."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Troy J.,",24-Nov-18,"The taste is okay. If you like sea weed I would recommend, otherwise the flavored ones still have a heavy taste of sea weed. Overall, I enjoyed the product, but probably will not purchase again due to the high price."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Rachel B.,",31-Oct-18,The ramen broth is actually very delicious but the noodles lacked taste and I did not like how stiff the seemed even after thouroughly cooking. I think there are many other ramen brands that have done a better job at a much lower cost.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Elaine W.,",08-Feb-19,"I couldn't find the snacks or noodles, so I had to get a Pho broth. The broth was good, but I really wanted to try the noodle bowls, noodles, or a snack or two."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Crystal B.,",26-Nov-18,"I would definitely tell ky friends about this product. I really enjoyed it, it was different than the snacks I'm used to. I like the wide variety of flavors that are offered. I will probably buy these again."
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Taryn P.,",11-Mar-19,I was not a fan flavor or texture - was very hard to find in store. Tried the Sea Salt and it just wasn't a great experience. Too much hassle for something I wouldn't buy again.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kendall M.,",04-Dec-18,Im not a huge fan of the lime flavor. It was a little off putting with seaweed . the Korean bbq on the other hand was pretty good couldnt really tell it was seaweed like most seaweed snacks on the market theres an aftertaste but not with these ones.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Joannie L.,",07-Feb-19,"At first i was weary of a product like this, it is definitely something new and different to what i would usually eat ...it was surprisingly good. the variety of flavors is helpful."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Heather-christina H.,",20-Dec-18,"Being a person that doesn't really like seafood, I should've known that I wouldn't have liked this product. Had a very fishy taste. Would recommend to individuals that live seafood and an ocean's taste but not for those who hate it"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cassandra J.,",10-Nov-18,"Did think I would like it, but it was okay. The sea salt on the Seaeeed snack was what I like most about it and it could fix in my pocket book.. I would recommend this to friends and family."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kristen E.,",22-Jan-19,"I thought trying flavored seaweed might make me enjoy it more, but nope. I just can't get into the taste of these. If you like seaweed products, you will enjoy, but I did not."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"KB C.,",15-Dec-18,"I bought the miso soup kit. It was easy to fix, but kind of bland. Might be a good starter for additions to spruce it up, I think I will try the seaweed snacks next as they are hard to mess up."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Laura H.,",07-Dec-18,"It wasn't that great. Had a weird taste to it. I doubt I will try the other flavors. The texture was off putting to me, too. ................................"

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mindy W.,",07-Dec-18,I received a coupon for the Ocean Halo's seaweed snacks to review for free! I chose the Chili Lime flavor. This was my first time trying seaweed and I would be okay if I never had it again. I'm guessing its an aquired taste just not for me.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Maranda P.,",06-Dec-18,I have eaten nori on sushi wraps but I guess ive never had seaweed snacks before. These were tough to out down. Had a spoiled fish flavor that I could not get past. Maybe thats just me though.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kayla W.,",26-Nov-18,"They were good, but they had an odd after taste. Maybe if I try another flavor next time? But overall, I would eat them again. I tried the BBQ ones and the barbecue was good, but like I said, it left a weird after taste."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Courtney A.,",12-Jan-19,My husband enjoyed these as a crunch in his daily linch at work. Easy to grab and go and thats another thing he loved! I was not so found of the seaweed texture but wouldn't mind as a once in awhile snack!
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda P.,",11-Dec-18,I have never tried seaweed so I cannot compare it to other brands but it was well flavored I tried the bacon flavor. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great tasting either just not my cup of tea.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kathy A.,",17-Jan-19,I'm sure it is tasty for someone who enjoys Pho. I have never had it before and prefer a different type of broth for my soups. I like that it has healthy ingredients and is Non GMO though. #trynatural #GotItFree
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Wendy S.,",22-Jan-19,Tried sea salt and was pretty bland. You really tasted the seaweed taste though. If your going for a nature taste definitely worth a try. Looking forward to trying one with more flavor
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephanie B.,",11-Mar-19,"I have been searching for healthier snacks for the kids, but I think the texture was the first turn off. I didn't really find the taste very appealing. Maybe I can test other flavors in the future."

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ember U.,",13-Jan-19,I had the chili lime and they were a unique snack. I liked how light and flavorful they were. They were a bit strong for me and I could only have a few at a time.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer V.,",06-Dec-18,"The ""bacon"" taste was the aftertaste, nothing like I expected. I was hoping for something to mask SOME of the seaweed taste but when I did get the ""bacon"" taste it was just a salty smokey flavor. It was ok, but not bacon."

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jennifer M.,",17-Dec-18,Ocean's Halo Seaweed Snacks are a healthy alternative snack and my husband would say for an acquired taste. I'm not sure it would be in my regular rotation but I'd consider it every few months or so for something different for certain.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tina S.,",22-Jan-19,I don't think it's for me. It had a good flavor and I'm trying to eat healthy but I don't think this is for me. I will tell my friend about them it's something she'd like. My taste buds aren't ready for these yet.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"chris C.,",26-Nov-18,We did not like it at all. It tasted like chili lime flavored fish. This was the worst thing I have ever attempted to eat. I am not sure if another flavor would be better or worse
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Mariagna P.,",05-Dec-18,It's was not my favorite thing but they have some other great things like the pho broth. I still can't find any store nearby that sells the noodles but can't wait to try them.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kara S.,",26-Nov-18,"I tried the bbq flavor. It was hard to find in stores. Decent taste, but still has the sea taste. Was hoping the bbq would mask it more. I think those who enjoy the flavor of seaweed will love these snacks."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Roxanne B.,",05-Dec-18,"I've been enjoying sushi and miso lately, so I wanted to try these. The seaweed is a bit too fishy for my taste. These might be okay as part of a soup or sushi bowl. I received this product free from Social Nature."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarah C.,",17-Dec-18,It had good texture and flavor. I don't think that I would eat it by itself again- but pairing it with rice or cauliflower to make it a bit more filling would be good option!
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"lindsay N.,",09-Nov-18,It was exactly like I imagined seaweed would taste. It wasn't bad but it wasn't my favorite or an item I would buy again for myself. However my husband really liked them and would eat them again as a snack.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Katey M.,",29-Nov-18,I got a coupon to try some of these so that's what I did. They weren't horrible the taste was okay but I don't care for the texture personally. The packaging was nice I just don't think I'm a seaweed person.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amy N.,",12-Nov-18,I didn't like these at all! They taste like fish which I do not like. I was hopeful the sriracha flavor would help but it does not. I like the nutritional info and the packaging. I just wish it tasted better.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda C.,",24-Feb-19,I thought it was unique and a bit salty for my taste. It is convenient and a healthy snack especially on the go. I would like to try the different flavors.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Karen B.,",31-Dec-18,"I tried the Wasabi and it wasn't the best flavor for me. I liked the texture and everything about the product, except for the flavor. I wish I had tried the sea salt or bacon."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Terri M.,",11-Nov-18,Not crazy about these. They may be healthy but not a fan. I could eat these if I had to but would choose other snacks first over these. Maybe I'll try another flavor and see if my opinion changes.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Aleksandra C.,",17-Feb-19,The taste of seaweed on its own was just too overpowering. It was a low calorie snack but not something I would ready for regularly. It was also very hard to find this at different stores.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Pamela M.,",05-Dec-18,I am just not a fan at all. I didn't like the flavor at all. I tried to get past the initial shock of what I was trying but it didn't make things any better. I am glad I got to try it for free but I don't think that I will be purchasing anymore.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Tracie D.,",07-Dec-18,I was offered a sample to try It wasn't for me but probably other people might like it I just didn't like that taste nothing really to do with the product itself
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carrie C.,",05-Dec-18,"I thought it was okay. I usually like seaweed snacks, but there was just an off flavor about them that I can't describe. I don't think it was the salt, but maybe. I would be willing to try them again, but a different flavor for sure"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Denise D.,",07-Dec-18,"I chose the sea salt flavor because it sounded like it would be the best tasting, but myself and my family wasn't to fond of the texture. So now I'm going to try another Halo product."
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Le'Sandra S.,",13-Jan-19,Was willing to try something new. It just wasn't for me. I couldn't get over the aftertaste. Not terrible but wouldn't do it again. I tried the bacon flavor.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"LaQuana G.,",10-Nov-18,It was my first time . I never had a seaweed before so the taste was different to me. I like the flavor and would recommend it to some friends. My kids didn't care for it but that's cool more for me. I would definitely try a different flavor.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Kathy C.,",15-Nov-18,"This wasn't for me, I think you should still try and give own opinion. I tried to go out of a comfort zone on this. Wasn't the worst thing, but won't purchase for myself"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Erin B.,",09-Dec-18,I personally did not care to much for them. But my kids loved them. So I would definitely purchase in the future. I did like the sea salt flavor the best.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alicia M.,",12-Nov-18,This is very likely to be blamed on the flavor. I was only able to find Sea Salt which really didn't mask any of the seaweed flavor for me. I would be willing to give it another go if I can find a better flavor.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Weejdaaaan N.,",07-Jan-19,"It was okay not my favorite, I do recommend it to someone who likes seaweed snacks.ive tried it before but wasn't a fan of seaweed and thought I'd give it another chance but i just don't like seaweed much."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Nicholas O.,",29-Oct-18,"It was ok, texture was kind of weird and the taste had a kind of spice to it. Overall, I will say it's not bad but I would want to taste more different flavors to see if the ""spice"" taste is natural since its seaweed."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sabina M.,",10-Jan-19,It was not as good as I thought it would be.I love seaweed but it just did not have enough flavor for me. Disappointed. Also the product does not have enough in it for the money it cost.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Alesha A.,",25-Jan-19,I think I might have been expecting something a little different. The Taste was terrible. It was more like taking I'm outside vitamin then having a snack.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jillian D.,",27-Oct-18,The sea salt was a little too salty. The bacon flavor adds a great flavor to noodles and other sides. An taste better as a snack than sea salt. Great for cooking!
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"James M.,",25-Nov-18,"I thought the sea salt flavor variety while fairly good, would not be an item that I could see eating on a regular basis, but would be an item that I would buy if none of my typical healthy snacks were availabe."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"amber C.,",26-Nov-18,"I did not enjoy these, but they could be for others! This was the first time I ever had any type of seaweed snack. The taste wasn't for me, but if others already like seaweed then I would try this!"

2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"sweety P.,",15-Dec-18,I tried Sea Salt flavor... but it has a little taste that I didn't find pleasant... These just a very thin paper like sheets.... hence not filling like any other snack... I would like to try Sriracha or Wasabi flavor...
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Janell E.,",13-Nov-18,"These were good but as an avid chip lover, it was difficult to really enjoy these. The flavor was nice and the health benefits are great! I would eat them but they wouldn't be my first choice."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lisa B.,",21-Feb-19,"This was not my favorite snack. I didn't like the aftertastes. I tried to like it, but I just couldn't, I am sure others would think differently but for me it was too salty and the aftertaste was unpleasant"
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ellery B.,",21-Nov-18,"This was not my cup of tea. I love all the aspects of this product, but am not a fan of the taste. This is definitely an acquired taste. If you like to try new things, this a very fun product to try."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Justin R.,",25-Oct-18,It's a different type of snack was expecting packed flavor grass instead like some old flavored car paint or burnt plastic bag. Was hoping to try one of the ramen or Noodle bowls but my store didn't stock them.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Carie L.,",18-Jan-19,Personally it isn't for me. But anyone who likes seaweed type snacks would love them. I didn't get a chance to try other flavors so that might make a difference. The wasabi was just to much for me.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"LEO P.,",20-Nov-18,This is definitely unusual and unique! A good try for nice snacking. Snack lovers should try these originals and see how the seaweed sheets affect your own mouth.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Amanda C.,",12-Jan-19,"They were ok, but not preferable to my taste. If you usually eat or buy these types of snacks, then I'm sure you will love them. They have a great texture and were fresh."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sarah B.,",17-Jan-19,"Tasted like sea weed haha! I got the chili lime one, the flavor wasn't overpowering, added something to a healthy snack. I'm not sure if I would purchase this on my own without a coupon."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Ken R.,",28-Dec-18,The product wasn't what I expected. I don't have a taste for this seaweed snack sheet. The flower masked the seaweed flavor. I would be curious what the most popular flavors are.
1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Christine T.,",25-Nov-18,I'm still trying to get this taste out of my mouth. It was fishy and overwhelming. This is not something that I would buy again or recommend to others.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Sandra P.,",12-Feb-19,I really did not care for this product. My expectations were somewhat high and that's maybe why. I would try different flavors to give them another try.
2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lisa T.,",09-Jan-19,"It was very expensive but I still tried it! After trying it, the flavor wasn't very strong and I couldn't really taste it. I'd just as same use water."

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Lindsey C.,",22-Jan-19,"I thought that these were okay, but the flavor I tried wasn't my favorite. I tried the chili lime flavor and it didn't have the strength that I was really looking for. I would have liked something a little more spicy possibly."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Shilo Y.,",30-Nov-18,These were just okay. I had never had them before so I dont know if it was this brand or the seaweed snacks in general that I didnt care for but. I was not a huge fan st all.

2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessica P.,",19-Nov-18,"The lime flavor just wasnt for me. It didn't particularly care for the texture either. They were different and it was great to get the opportunity to try them. However, they just aren't for me."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Liz D.,",18-Nov-18,"It was okay. I wasn't overly thrilled about the taste. I had the Sea Sal chocolate but it didn't taste as chocolate as expected. It was very chewy, which was okay but I did not care for the overall taste."
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Jessica D.,",22-Feb-19,"Interesting, in a good way for sure. I'm not sure I'd get it again but they weren't bad. I think I'm just not used to the taste of seaweed, so just different."

2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"April M.,",23-Nov-18,i got these today and chose the bacon flavor. i have to say they were kind of strange and we didnt really like them. they were real salty which we usually like but these arent for us.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Cassie K.,",16-Nov-18,I tried the ramen kit and i didn't love it but i didn't hate it. The broth qas what got me and the noodles did not cook very well. I probably would not buy this again.
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"BJ M.,",28-Oct-18,"So these were definitely different. I thought they were okay, but I would say I'm not a fan. They are very healthy and would be a great snack. They are only 20 calories for one pack! That is great!"
3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Peggy O.,",06-Dec-18,"The Oceans Halo Seaweed snacks were a new experience for me. When I first ate them I didn't like them, but after a while the taste really grows on you."

1,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Johnette G.,",08-Jan-19,"I am always looking for ways to curb snaking during the day. I was excited to try the Ocean's Halo Organic Seaweed Snacks, but for me they were not what I expected. It is definitely an acquired taste."

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"terry H.,",18-Nov-18,"I think this snack was okay. It was not out of this world delicious.

2,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Stephen H.,",12-Jan-19,"Perhaps because there products do not move very rapidly I may have gotten one that was a bit stale, but I was not impressed with it.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Dianne D.,",26-Oct-18,"I bought the sea salt flavor seaweed chips. The are tasty, but also somewhat fishy. Keep that in mind if you decide to buy them. It's not a filling snack, but it is good to quickly satisfy a craving."

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Linda J.,",12-Feb-19,Easy bag to open. Used these for ramen soup. Wasabi were the best knes. Price in market is ok not to expensive. Would still buy these. Can also used for appetizer.

3,Organic Seaweed Snacks Review,"Michelle D.,",22-Feb-19,I tried the sea salt and Texas bbq. I thought the seas alt tasted a little too fishy for me. The Texas bbq was really unique and would definitely purchase that flavor again. Also think i will try the Maui onion and some of the other flavors.
