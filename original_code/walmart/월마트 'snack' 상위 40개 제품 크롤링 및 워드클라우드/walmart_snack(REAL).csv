They are delicious And I will enjoy Purchasing and eating them much more frequently than the original flavor cheese it's. The light flavor surprisingly was a tasty and very filling snack cracker.

5,"Cheez-It, Baked Snack Cheese Crackers, White Cheddar, Family Size, 21 Oz","Cspaulding,",10-Apr-20,"I have been a Cheez-It fan for about twenty years now. I've tried a few different flavors over the years but have never came across the White Cheddar. This box contained 45 bags of them, so I figured what better way to help my kids through this month of not being in daycare and staying at home. Opening the box, I took a bag and my three year old took another bag. The taste was just as great as the original flavor but offered something new! So excited to finish this box in the next few weeks! Cheez-It fan for life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

5,"Cheez-It, Baked Snack Cheese Crackers, White Cheddar, Family Size, 21 Oz","69Pace,",08-Apr-20,"Cheeze-It is our favorite brand for cheese crackers. The authentic cheese flavor keeps us coming back to it. The White Cheddar flavor has the right combination of white cheddar cheese flavor, crunchiness and salt. Although it does leave a slight cheese residue on your fingers, it not as much as other fake cheese snacks would leave and stain your fingers. The 45-pouch box is great for families to have handy to provide snacks for lunches, work or on-the-go. Each pouch has a generous number of crackers which was enough to curve my appetite when eaten as a snack and a perfect side for a lunch. The white cheddar flavor is indulging. Although each pouch helps with portion control, it is so easy to eat another pouch! In addition to being the perfect size snack, it can also be used in recipes. My wife used two pouches, crumbled the crackers and sprinkled it over her homemade mac-and-cheese prior to baking it. It was delicious! I highly recommend these and are much healthier because they are baked and made with 100% real cheese. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I left the box out on the open so when my boys and their friends wanted a snack, the bags were right there available. There is actually a fair amount of crackers in each bag. Plus, they're not messy. Hardly nothing left on the fingers. This is a great snack to have around the house!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

5,"Cheez-It, Baked Snack Cheese Crackers, White Cheddar, Family Size, 21 Oz","DJDoughertyVA,",18-Apr-20,"When we first received these, I was like ""all right, more Cheez-Its!"" After all, this brand is well known to us, but we had always gone with the ""standard"" cheddar options. Bad move. The white cheddar variety is crisp, tasty, and possibly even more flavorful. They're a little on the salty side, but that really doesn't matter if you're eating from the snack bags. The portion is perfect, and you get just enough to sate your desire for a cheese fix."

Walmart delivers again on quality products as promised.

He loves to give people things and I try to send him something fun to give out for Halloween to both the residents and the staff. They are all wonderful! Since I am in Texas, his wonderful Social Coordinator on staff offered to go pick them up at the Secaucus, NJ Sams for me and deliver them to Uncle Sonny's room. I called him thinking he would hold onto them until....you guessed it....Halloween. He called and was so excited because everyone he gave one to LOVED THEM and according to him WAS A BIG HIT! So, if you will let the Manager know at the Secuccus, NJ SAMS that Anthony Rossi in Room 231P is in need of more goodies including these wonderful ""Big Hit"" Halloween Pretzels to pass out to all residents and his wonderful staff again on Halloween Eve! Thanks, Kathy Rossi"

The crackers are still as good, the flavor and crunchiness still the same, When I first opened the jar, I did not remove the foil seal, I just opened it enough to get crackers out and place the red top back on. I think that helps to keep them fresh. great quality for a low price."

5,"Pringles, Potato Crisps Chips, Original, 5.2 Oz","ThePhlegmAndMucusMaster,",29-Apr-20,"I believe this item cost $1.44. A Great Value (Wal-Mart brand) 12oz. can of tuna fish is like $1.58, almost the same price as the can of Pringles, but you can't ever get the much more healthier option (the tuna fish), delivered, over the can of potato chips, online, and the one you can store for long periods of time. During hostile, dangerous, combative, sketchy, scary times, like COVID-19/coronavirus outbreaks, Wal-Mart needs to make essential food staples, on the ready, for their local population via their online source, w/much higher limits, like '10', instead of only one, or often times 'none' ('sold out'). Canned tuna, canned salmon, Great Value dry roasted, and honey roasted, peanuts, all of which either have ONE ITEM LIMITS, or are consistently SOLD OUT. Another type of health food I like a lot (*sarcasm alert*) are the Great Value version of 'Pop-Tarts', which are much better and cheaper than the Kellogg's name brand, and yes, often sold out too."

2,"Pringles, Potato Crisps Chips, Original, 5.2 Oz","NunyaBis,",22-Mar-20,"I gave this 1-star rating, ---- really a 0 star, BUT i see you automatically force 2 stars on a person when they only select a 1-star rating on your products. And about these chips: all of the Pringles were broken into crumbs in each canister, except 8 of them --- a person would have to use a SPOON to eat these!!!! And why does the back ""Nutrition Facts"" Label, look so yellow-dingy, as if it was sitting in someone's garage for 60 years? And i know the products that i shop for (it's content and packaging), and the clear plastic 'lid' on these Pringles cans seems to be a different kind of [hard] plastic, as opposed to softer, bendable, plastic lid,.... it seems counterfeit! --- Oh wait! what do i see here?! some type of Chinese, or Thailand print on the back of the can, why is that, Walmart?! Are there any regulations, and Quality-Control pertaining to these products. Where's the integrity, honesty, ?! .....In year 2017, things seemed to be different, in a Negative way, in America regarding integrity, and doing the right things towards Citizens and Consumers who, both: are tax-payers; and who PAY FOR THEIR STORE ITEMS, INCLUDING LOCAL TAXES ON EACH ITEM; and INCLUDING SHIPPING/DELIVERY!!!! (i had to vent). Therefore, why did i get Pringles crumbles, instead of Pringles chips? I don't feel too at ease eating these chips. Also, please, Walmart: If you say in the details that items are ""sold by Walmart,"" and/or, ""shipped by Walmart,"" then DO NOT sell the customers those ""third-party vendor"" products, which are not your Walmart ""in-store"" products!!!! --- All customers should start demanding transparency of: 1). who are the manufacturers of each product, and their location; 2)and who are the distributors of each product, and their location. ---- I prefer to know where my food products, and non-food products are manufactured and distributed from."

5,"belVita Soft Baked Banana Bread Breakfast Biscuits, 5 Packs (1 Biscuit Per Pack)",,11-Jun-20,I would buy these way more often if it wasn't for the price. Do you have little bits of some kind of whole gra in something or maybe oats and it just really makes the flavor really interesting and creates a dynamic texture that can go from soft baked as they advertise with a few crunchy bits that you might get. The flavor is really good.

4,"Chex Mix Indulgent Turtle Snack Mix, 14 oz Family Size","Ancianoloco,",08-Aug-18,I found the picture on the package was a fair representation of the contents. Not too much popcorn (maybe not enough... but it is Chex after all). I enjoyed the sweet and salt balance and the little chocolate candies do have a tendency to settle to the bottom of the bag. The one star ratings always confuse me. How anyone can dislike a product for being as advertised: containing popcorn and being sweet... they're out there though.

I thought I was buying a salty spicy item. But it's so sweet it almost gagged me. I have an eaten sweet things in quite a while. I am a dyed in the wool card-carrying diabetic it was quite a shock. It tasted wonderful but I had to spit it out. just pay attention when you order I didn't know it was sweet.

Great with soups or great all by themselves. Might try putting peanut butter and jelly on them for a walk back to a time when you were a kid and your mom put half-a-dozen of them together in your lunch box. Cheese goes good with them, too. My niece likes dipping them in Ranch Dressing. You get the idea."

They still have the great taste that I remember whether with or without a topping. My favorite topping to put on my Ritz is peanut butter, and the Family-size Ritz is my favorite size to purchase since they last much longer than the other sizes. The only thing that I would change is the individual cracker size. When I first started eating them all those years ago, they were much bigger. Now I can get a whole one into my mouth (when no-one is looking)."
,,,,
4,"RITZ Fresh Stacks Original Crackers, Family Size, 17.8 oz","deathbyaraven,",16-Jul-20,"Yummy and a very good price the problem is is everytime I get them they look like somebody deliberately squash them into a box with my other things and the box often comes squashed and torn. I love these crackers I buy myself the low-fat frozen whipped topping and I take a little pack of these crackers and I dip it into that frozen whipped topping and it's like salty and sweet ice cream at the same time it's good. Sometimes, I buy the Frozen topping and I slice it in the container and I put a big chunk between two graham crackers and it's like a low-calorie ice cream sandwich try it"

Not, some packaging whiz came up with the Idea of cutting the size of the package in half. So what you say, well if I'm opening packs to put on a tray they just doubled my workload.

I do warn you to watch for the best buy on boxes listed at Walmart as some are very over priced for the amount of snacks per box. Check the .8 Oz snack per box and the amount prior to purchase as it will be worth you while. Some of those Market Places charge a fortune for the same thing! The Motts Assorted Fruit Flavors are delicious anytime you want a little snack in the house or in the car!

My kids eat them well and always finish the bag. I've never experienced expired or stale chips in them. They have always tasted fresh. I like having the variety to choose from. Easy to open and store. It would be nice if the prices of them didn't appear to keep going up. They were a little over $5. But last time I noticed they were a little over $6. Other than being on the slightly pricey side they are good. I wish great value would come a kale theirs like this. They are much more cost effecient and taste the exact same.

The Jalapeno Jack cheese gives enough heat to let you know it's there, but does not set you up for the ""burn"" of flaming hot pepper products. These bite back in a way that allows you to enjoy these and look forward to the next one out of the bag. These fall into that ""just right"" category."

I don't understand why there is garlic powder, onion powder in a cheese cracker. If I wanted an onion flavor I would buy the sour cream and onion flavor. I don't get it. And Iove Cheez-it, but not Snap'd. They were so bad I had to throw them out."

2,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","Lena,",16-Jul-20,"Although I LOVE LOVE the Cheez-It Original Baked Crackers I cannot say the same for the Cheez-It Snap'd Double Cheese. The downfall was my first try in my mouth it tasted like onion not cheesy at all especially being advertised with double cheese. If I wanted an onion taste I would have bought the Cheddar Sour Cream with Onion. Why does it need dried potatoes in the ingredients? It made my stomach feel heavy. The only thumbs up is the thin and crispy texture and not too salty. If the Cheez-It Snap'd Double Cheese could have all the ingredients and taste of the Cheez-It Original Baked Snack Crackers, still be thin, crispy and cheesy - you'll definitely have something then. Please go back to the drawing board. Sorry to say I'll PASS on another bag."

5,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","AmandaRN,",29-Mar-20,"I'd bought these a few weeks ago, for my picky 7 year old who refused to try them. She's picky and will only eat the original Chesz-Its. Last night, my husband and I were playing a late-night game of Rummy and I wanted a snack. Our quarantine snack stash is running low, so I grabbed these out of the pantry and decided to try them. They exceeded any expectations I could have had and more! From the perfect level of crispiness in each bite to the incredible flavor - we almost ate the entire bag. Oops! Looks like they are going to be an ¡°essential item¡± in this household.... now, to find a grocery store that's not completely out of stock...."

4,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","nogoshopper,",05-Feb-20,"A different kind of cheese snack. They almost want to be a Cheetos product but not quite that. They are less dense and you could probably eat hundreds before feeling satisfied. I think the commercial exaggerated the cheesiness as they are lightly dusted. Still, worth the try!"

2,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","Eboni,",16-Jan-20,"I was dissappointed in the product. I recieved a bag of crumbs with very few whole chips. Couldn't put out for guest. My dogs liked them LOL. I will go back to the thicker ones, even though more calories. You need to make a little thicker or make sure stores are handling them with care."

2,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","CruxisRex,",01-Mar-20,"we tried to Flavors. Double cheese, and sour cream. Both were a disappointment. Starting with the good, of which there is only one point, we really enjoyed the light crispy texture of these. Now for the not so good. Neither of these flavors, and this is NOT an exaggeration, had even the faintest hint of cheese flavor. Literally none. Even the most bland store brand cheesy snacks put these to shame. these may be the least cheesiest cheesy snack I've ever had. after eating a few, I was getting a familiar flavor. Pringles. They taste a lot like Pringles. They have that artificial potato sludge flavor. A look at the ingredients confirms it. There is potato in these. perhaps it's to get that crispy texture, or perhaps it's just too cut the mix with cheap low-quality ingredients, but it's not pleasant. the sour cream ones were slightly better because of the seasoning, but the double cheese ones tasted like unseasoned Pringles. If you're looking for a Cheesy snack, this isn't it. If that's what you want, you're better off with normal Cheez-Its, or what I prefer, Planters cheez balls."

I love how crispy, thin and flavorful these are (and I do not like the cheez it crackers - never have - sorry) - finally a snack idea that is outside the box of your typical snacks!"
,,,,
1,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","Andersonfam,",28-Jan-20,We are a huge Cheez-it household. The new Snap'd ad drew us in and we purchased the double cheese flavor. It was awful. It leaves a disgusting taste in my mouth and not even my 2 year old would eat more than one. Disappointing coming from a brand we love.
,,,,
2,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","LoriA,",13-Apr-20,"At first bite these were not at all what I expected. I even looked at the label-twice-to be sure I had bought the Double Cheese flavor that I wanted! What I got instead was a very thin and crispy little cracker that tasted overwhelmingly like garlic, sour cream, and onion. That's why I checked the label twice, and why I came back here to read the description. This chip tasted nothing at all like a Cheez-it! Why would I buy a chip with the Cheez-it name if it doesn't taste like that product? Nowhere does it state that it will taste like sour cream and onion chips. I expect garlic as a basic seasoning, but not as strong as this had. After searching through the ingredients list I did find those flavors, stating it contained less than 2%. It sure tasted like more to me. What my 2¡Ù opinions came down to was that I liked the crispy texture and bite of these chips. But I'll be giving them to a friend because I wanted cheese-flavored Cheez-it taste. Not sour cream, onion, and garlic chips. I didn't get what the label claimed was inside the bag."

3,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","Amy,",12-Feb-19,"My family of 5 loved the taste of the Cheez-its snap'd thins. They were flavorful and crisp with the right amount of salt. Each pack only had 6-8 crisps though. The packaging says 50 calories. I'd rather it said 150 calories and have 20 crisps to eat. These are not filling as a snack and because of the low quantity in the bags, these will not be purchased as school snacks. We do love these crisps and would love to eat a handful of them. I give 5 stars for the crisp, 1 for the quantity, 5 for the easy open packaging #cheezeitsnapdpack #sponsored [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The first to try was our 2 year old who ate 3 of the bags in one sitting. Next were the boys and a little later a few friends came over and we had them try as well! All thought they were delicious and the boys are begging for them in their lunches. The flavor is super cheesy! They're light and crispy which make for a perfect snack.

I usually feel like there's a film left in my mouth when I eat certain chips and crackers, which literally leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Not these! These were dusted with enough cheese flavor and were crispy enough that it felt like a chip. I can't wait to try another flavor at the store. No one who sampled a bag complained about them and had positive reviews as well. My daughter's face lit up when she saw I had a bag of them and it was the needed pick me up as she waited for dinner to be done. I loved these and will be buying more.

I love the thin and crispy cheesy flavor. My friends and I did a comparison between snap'd with another brand and wow, snap'd was our number one snack. I am so in love with snap'd that I had to buy ALL the available flavors at my local supermarket. The awesome part is after sharing with my friends, they also went out to get some for themselves, lol.

4,"Cheez-It, Cheesy Baked Snacks, Double Cheese, 7.5 Oz","Sam,",01-Mar-19,"So, the CheezIt Snap'd crackers were quite a bit saltier than I expected. However, they were just as addicting as I expected. Once you get started, its hard to stop...... hint, don't eat them straight out of the bag. The crackers are a good size, big enough to bite or small enough to stick the whole thing in your mouth. I would say these appeal more to teens and adults than younger children. Overall, grab a bag, or 12, and try some. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

They are the perfect cheese snack. I was very suprised that this company came out with these new Snap'd ceesy, thin and rispy snacks. I love that they are thin and crispy and seem to have a little puff to them. With that said, it was alot of cheese ?. I would definitely eat them again but they arent my favorite. My family and friends seemed to think the same thing. I guess you really do get what they say. ""DOUBLE CHEESE"". i have not tried any other flavors... Yet. But i do intend to look for them on my next trip to the grocery store. I think if i dip them in something, maybe a sour creem or artichoke dip, they would be great!!

Definitely worth getting in the small packs as far as calories go (only 50 per pack), though there's only about 6 crackers each so they might leave you wanting more.

I won't lie to everyone, I am not a cracker person. If I do buy crackers its for an off brand of something or other for the kids, never anything for myself. I was very skeptical that I would like this, and was fully prepared to get reviews from my friends who were going to sample with me. Oh boy, was I wrong, so wrong. I love these little bites of cheesy, crispy goodness. I have to admit, I am a little addicted. If a cracker and a chip had a baby, then this is it, a cracker/chip hybrid like a cronut but oh so savory. The crunch is irresistible, the cheddar, not overpowering but packed full of flavor, and it is so light and thin. Perfect.

They didn't have any aftertaste and the flavor was true to cheese flavor it didn't have an artificial taste to it. However the cracker itself was not light and crispy in a dry crumble way which is how I prefer a cracker, instead after the initial crunch it seemed dense and almost chewy like I would imagine a stale biscuit would be. If you prefer a chewy cracker then these are perfect since the flavor is amazing, but if you like a dry crumbly cracker then the texture just isn't right.

They seem more like a chip to me though, not so much like a cracker. I think I would need to eat more of them than a regular cheez-it to feel satisfied. The snack size pouch was certainly not enough for me! You can't beat a free sample though! If I buy them in the future I would look for a full size package. #CheezItSnapdPack #Sponsored [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

No one could get the chip thickness or seasoning down. Some are even downright greasy! Leave it to the Cheez-it brand to get it right! These Snap'd cracker to ""chips"" are crisp, light, and seasoned perfectly. Only complaint is that 50 calorie bags are torture since they don't leave you satisfied. Have to eat two bags in a sitting.

After tasting them I still felt the same. I was happy to have the #Sponsored box of them to share with my friends family and neighbors and we all unanimously agree that there should be more crackers in each pack. I love normal CheezIts and was very excited to try these. While they are tasty, I think I will stick with the original crackers. They are thin and crispy as advertised, but were also a little thin on flavor as well. My kids liked them and asked for more so I like they they feel like a lighter snack for the kids, but maybe I'm just a traditionalist when it comes to CheezeIts, but I'm sticking with the original crackers.

I've never been a big fan of Chex Mix & thought I'd give it another go, but it's what I remembered...mostly tasteless. They have to season it or throw in some potent bits in order to offer any kind of Mix Variety. Chex Mix would likely do much better using Life cereal squares instead. Sorry but, tasteless cardboard waffles don't improve unless your first improve them."

2,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","Tammylynn1226,",22-Aug-16,I bought the Walmart trail mix I gave it a fair rating because the raisins were horrible tasting not to mention the size of a grape tomato they took the major weight of the bag which was less nuts in the bag if they can ditch the grape size raisins it would make a better trail mix.

1,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","Chris,",25-Feb-16,"I used to love this trail mix! Its so sad wal-mart changed the mixture. Now its mostly raisins and peanuts. Staying true to their business plan, if Walmart can save 1/100 of a cent reducing the M&M's, then they must go... reading other reviews, I see others are just as unhappy as me. Its really turned me off to all Great Value products. There is NO value in a product marketed to be what its not, slowly changed over time to cheapen it, and doesn't contain the highest of quality ingredients when it comes to food. Back to quality trail mix for me that is well worth double the price. (save me Whole Foods... please build store next to every Walmart...)"

I did notice that there was a lot of salt on the raisins and a lot of the raisins were in big clumps. Also there were not too many chocolate prices. The taste was okay but kind of bland. There was a ton of salt in the trail mix. I found it to be over bearing to the point that I did not enjoy it. It is a good price for what you get. I just wish that 1. There was less salt, 2. More chocolate pieces, and 3. A better variety of nuts."

5,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","Bearangel,",29-Nov-15,"We love Mountain Trail mix by itself or combining with the Indulgence mix. The nuts are fresh, the raisins are plumb and big, and the candy tastes just like the brand name. I especially like the cashew haves and my husband loves the almonds. We always take a bag with us when we are traveling long distances as it not only satisfies our hunger but gives us what we need to stay awake. We also keep a bag on hand at home for that mid afternoon snack. What more can I say except SWEET and SALTY. Ahhhhhhh!"
,,,,
5,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","CaringGramma,",01-Sep-17,We fly through these at my house. Something to grab between meals or keep in a backpack or purse when on the run. Easy access and a little chocolate too. This is my fourth purchase and it is now a regular item on my shopping list! The kids love this when they don't feel like cooking or making something like a sandwich. Beats chips and other junk food.
,,,,
1,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","Krista,",22-Mar-18,"Not good trail mix. It has no added flavor. The nuts are not tasty, there are very few M&Ms, and there are more raisins than anything else. I've bought this a couple times because there is such a small selection of trail mix at my Walmart store. Neither time did I finish the bag that I bought. It's just not good. No wonder they don't carry other trail mix; then no one would buy this (the Walmart brand). I'm getting trail mix elsewhere."

I will try different trail mix from different vendors until find I can tolerate. I know I may not find as good as yours but I can or will pay this new price.

2,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","Hartley8502020,",30-Oct-16,I usually buy this trail mix once a week and I usually don't have a problem with it but until this time I open it and I literally found only 5 m&m in the bag .. I'm not sure if it was accident or on purpose. I love this trail mix but it was pretty upsetting when you buy a 26 oz bag that says made with m&m's and you only find this small amount in such a big bag
,,,,
4,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","donna,",03-Mar-16,"I have been snacking on this trail mix for years! I love the nuts and raisins and the M & Ms are just enough to take care of the chocolate cravings. I like a higher ratio of nuts to raisins, so I usually add a jar of unsalted dry roasted peanuts. Although, I have noticed some inconsistencies in quality from bag to bag. Some bags have raisins that are salted. I do not like salted raisins. If I wanted a salted snack, I would eat chips. Also, in some bags the raisins are tiny, too dried, and have a bitter taste. I usually pick these out."
,,,,
5,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","Michelle,",01-Dec-15,Yummy and filling. Love the M'n'M's! Good snack when you're in a rush. My boyfriend takes a snack bag filled with this trail mix to work and his co workers always ask for a handful when they see he has it. Walmart has other combinations as well but we haven't tried them yet. I know there's one with peanut butter chips and I think a tropical fruit one. At least one other I can't recall at the moment.

I also purchase this for my elderly mother who resides in a nursing home. She needs the peanuts for protein, the raisins are great to keep her regular and the M&Ms are just enough sugar to keep her happy. It has appeared in the last two bags that I've purchased that there are less nuts in the bag, would definitely recommend even portions."

5,"Great Value Mountain Trail Mix, 26 Oz.","shhain,",27-Aug-15,"I have been buying the kirkland trail mix from costco and this product is the same quality and very similar in content. Unfortunately you have to buy 4 lbs of bulk at costco or 2lbs individual packets for $20. So if you don't need more than 1.5 pounds which I think is about what this product is, then buy it with confidence. If you want the 4 lbs then the costco trail mix is the same thing. They are both comparable in taste and value. My 21 year old son didn't even know I switched out the products."

The price works out to about 40 cents each, which is a great price since they run about $1 or more now in a convenience store. The BUT is for the cashews in the package. Each one we opened was more ""bits and pieces"" than the whole (or even half) nut. The taste doesn't change, it's just that they are all broken up and hard to put in your hand without loosing pieces. This won't keep us from buying them again. Just a heads-up for consumers."

They can be eaten by themselves as a snack or with a salad etc. They are not fattening but with anything should be eaten in moderation. I would definitely recommend and will be buying these all the time.

5,"Fruit Roll-Ups, Fruit by the Foot & Gushers, 9.96 oz","Lisa,",01-Jul-20,"Am making little care packages for friends- corona style- and bought these to add in. Was nervous from some other reviews stating there wasn't enough in the box, was only one type or some of the gushers only had ONE within the pack. The box i received today had all 24 pieces, 10 fruit rollups, 10 fruit by the foot and 4 gushers (each with 4-5 pieces inside). If you're mainly buying for the gushers-> i would do a separate full box as the bags are tiny even for a kid. But this is perfect for what i needed- which was mostly the other two types."

There were only 3 packs of gushers out of the hole 24 count: in one pack there was ONE SINGLE gusher, in the second pack there were THREE and in the last there were only FOUR."
